          <Text style={p}>You may be wondering:</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>"Is it okay to orgasm if you have a porn addiction?"</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>Whenever asking these kinds of questions, it can always help to come back to The Five Principles Of NeverFap.</Text>

<Text style={p}>And this particular question primarily relates to <Text style={{textDecoration: "underline"}}>Struggle over none</Text> and how orgasming affects our ability to overcome porn addiction.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Personally speaking I do not think it&rsquo;s okay to orgasm if you have a porn addiction and I&rsquo;ve even taught myself not to orgasm during sex, so it&rsquo;s a guiding principle I take quite seriously.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Essentially, the reason why I don&rsquo;t orgasm is quite simple.</Text>

<View style={hr4}/>

<Text style={h4}>The act of orgasming messes with your emotions.</Text>

<View style={hr4__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>At the end of the day, I don&rsquo;t particularly care about the philosophical, nor even the moral arguments behind watching porn, nor even abstaining from it.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Ultimately I&rsquo;m a processes kind of guy, which means I care solely about the easiest and most efficient way to achieve something.</Text>

<Text style={p}>So with this in mind, orgasming simply makes it harder to overcome porn addiction, whether it&rsquo;s to porn or not.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Whenever you orgasm you still experience that intense dopamine rush which more-or-less makes regulating your emotions impossible.</Text>

<Text style={p}>And as I state on this website, 5% of your time should be spent practicing Healthy Coping Mechanisms, while the other 95% of your time should be spent remaining calm and relaxed.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>Certainly, it's incredibly difficult to remain calm and relaxed after an orgasm.</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>Especially if you&rsquo;ve been abstaining for weeks on end, as well as avoiding any kind of stimulus.</Text>

<Text style={p}>It will hit you like a train, and your emotions will suffer big time.</Text>

<Text style={p}>It&rsquo;s the same reason why you also shouldn&rsquo;t binge eat carbs or take copious amounts of drugs on a daily basis.</Text>

<Text style={p}>It makes it incredibly difficult to regulate your emotions in regards to the dopamine response that ensues.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Orgasming, something which produces an excessive amount of dopamine - really is no different.</Text>

<Text style={p}>You can sell it however you want as something that&rsquo;s inherently &ldquo;natural&rdquo; or &ldquo;porn-free&rdquo; and therefore okay.</Text>

<Text style={p}>However so was excessive war and smoking at one point in human history, so I don&rsquo;t think these kinds of personal expectations based on the standards of society are valid.</Text>

<Text style={p}>At the end of the day, you&rsquo;re going to have a much easier time overcoming your porn addiction by refraining from these behaviours in general.</Text>

<Text style={p}>What <Text style={{textDecoration: "underline"}}>Struggle over none</Text> describes is that everything we do should make overcoming our porn addiction easier, not harder.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Furthermore, there&rsquo;s no reason at all why you should ever need to orgasm, even during sex.</Text>

<Text style={p}>What NeverFap Deluxe is about instead, is developing control over your mind so that you have freedom over your life.</Text>

<Text style={p}>So you don&rsquo;t feel as if you need to use porn, orgasm or masturbation as a form of release or self-expression.</Text>

<Text style={p}>You can simply be thriving and happy, just the way you are.</Text>
