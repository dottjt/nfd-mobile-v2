        <Text style={p}>Most porn addicts struggle with judgement, whether judging others or feeling judged themselves.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Certainly, it&rsquo;s part of the reason why we fall into these cycles of watching porn, immediately criticising ourselves for our actions, which then makes us feel worse about ourselves, which then propels us to continue watching porn and continue masturbating in order to feel better.</Text>

<Text style={p}>It&rsquo;s a cycle I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re more-than familiar with, just as I once was.</Text>

<Text style={p}>This response of self-criticism is one which often runs deep into how we think, as a habit which most people have developed since childhood.</Text>

<Text style={p}>A habit which has become so prominent in our lives, that we simply don&rsquo;t even realise we&rsquo;re doing it much, if any of the time.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Usually because when we make a judgement it can happen so quickly and so automatically.</Text>

<Text style={p}>To a point where we may have even begun to view it as something normal, rather than something harmful that needs to be addressed.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>Especially, if it's a judgement directed at ourselves.</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>Which is to say that we are our own worst critic.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Whether through habits we developed from our parents or perhaps learnt via our own means, self-judgement is arguably one of the most harmful things we do as human beings.</Text>

<Text style={p}>And it&rsquo;s the reason why we find ourselves stuck in these cycles of addiction, as well as feel terrible about ourselves, often for no reason at all.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Essentially, many of us have a habit of telling ourselves off whenever we feel as if we&rsquo;ve done something wrong.</Text>

<Text style={p}><Text style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t have stared at that woman.&rdquo;</Text></Text>

<Text style={p}><Text style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t be feeling this way.&rdquo;</Text></Text>

<Text style={p}><Text style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe I did that.&rdquo;</Text></Text>

<Text style={p}>All trains of thought which lead to despair, hopelessness and self-harm i.e. watching porn.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Of course, if reacting with judgement is all you know, then it will inherently feel like a natural thing to do, even inspite of reading these words.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>Well, I'm here to tell you today that it's not natural, and that it's a learnt habit no different to smoking everyday or being abusive towards others.</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>It&rsquo;s an aspect of your personality which you have developed, and which you have likely reinforced every single day since you were young.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Which is fine, because through awareness we can change these behaviours for the better.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Certainly, I used to be incredibly self-critical up until my early 20s, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s the only way to think about life.</Text>

<Text style={p}>The alternative on the other hand is not to judge, and instead, to refrain from having an opinion.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Which may sound baffling to some, but it&rsquo;s also incredibly sound if you take the time to actually think about it.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Which is to say that instead of reacting with judgement, the idea is to remain calm at all times.</Text>

<Text style={p}>If not because remaining calm is what allows you to be effective with anything you do, whether it be working on your ambitions or simply being happy within the moment.</Text>

<Text style={p}>So how do you get to this point?</Text>

<Text style={p}>Essentially, by developing your awareness so you can catch those judgements as they happen, and in future prevent yourself from reacting at all.</Text>

<Text style={p}>At first you&rsquo;ll only be able to catch yourself mid-judgement.</Text>

<Text style={p}>However the longer you practice this, the better you&rsquo;ll be able to catch yourself ahead of time, and eventually the whole process will become so automatic that you won&rsquo;t even have to think about it.</Text>

<Text style={p}>You will simply exist judgement free.</Text>

<Text style={p}>There&rsquo;s a specific practice which helps target this called <Text style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>Catch Out Your Judgements</Text> in the practices section of the website.</Text>

<Text style={p}>I highly recommend checking it out.</Text>
