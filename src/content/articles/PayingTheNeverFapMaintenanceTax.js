<Text style={p}>What exactly is the NeverFap Maintenance Tax?</Text>

<Text style={p}>Well, aside from the fact that it&rsquo;s a term I&rsquo;ve more-or-less made up on the spot, the NeverFap Maintenance Tax refers to the time and effort required in order to maintain our physical and mental health.</Text>

<Text style={p}>It includes things like meditation, exercising, relaxing, studying, meditating, eating and brushing our teeth.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Everything that helps us keep regular.</Text>

<Text style={p}>The reason why I call it a tax is because many of us have the attitude that maintaining these things is simply unnecessary.</Text>

<Text style={p}>In fact, most of us can tend to view these things as a burden (usually due to the amount of time associated with actually doing them), despite the positive benefits they provide.</Text>

<Text style={p}>So what ends ups happening is that become selective about what we view as necessary or not.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Maybe we don’t exercise, because we’d rather be studying or playing video games. Maybe we work or study too hard, because we don’t see the value in meditating or relaxing.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>In doing this, we make significant compromises to our ability to function.</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>And what’s really disturbing, is how utterly unaware we are of how much we compromise in terms of our ability to function, often without truly being aware of it.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Certainly, I’ve been there.</Text>

<Text style={p}>And only now in retrospect do I realise how I was making something like giving up porn addiction almost impossible due to my own negative attitudes towards self-care.</Text>

<View style={hr2}/>

<Text style={h2}>In other words, if you’re struggling with your porn addiction it may be because you’re not paying your maintenance tax in full.</Text>

<View style={hr2__bottom}/>







<Text style={p}>In order to demonstrate this, I’m first going to talk about where I personally was making those compromises in my life.</Text>

<Text style={p}>And then explain the effect it was having on my ability to cope.</Text>

<Text style={p}>As well as what successfully paying the maintenance tax actually entails.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>Facing the consequences of imbalance</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>Prior to this realisation, I was under the impression that I was relatively functional and healthy.</Text>

<Text style={p}>I was exercising three times a week. I was eating healthily. I was in a fantastic relationship. I was incredibly passionate about studying and I was full of ambition, ready to take on the world.</Text>

<Text style={p}>On the other hand, there were other aspects of my life that were severely imbalanced.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Aside from being severely addicted to porn, I was beginning to suffer from anxiety attacks from my excessive studying.</Text>

<Text style={p}>I was studying so much that it used to induce these kinds of &lsquo;coding nightmares&rsquo; where I would be mentally coding in my sleep, but stuck in an indefinite loop where I would just write the same code again and again and again.</Text>

<Text style={p}>It was truly awful.</Text>

<Text style={p}>My problem was that I was pushing myself too hard and I didn’t provide myself with the opportunity to relax.</Text>

<Text style={p}>All because I didn&rsquo;t view relaxation as a form of maintenance, in part because I was so obsessed with being productive and not falling behind.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Once I&rsquo;d respected this balance however (primarily by not overworking myself to death) I was able function more clearly.</Text>

<Text style={p}>And most importantly, regain control over my emotions so that my cravings for porn could become a thing of the past.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Of course, you may have an opposite problem. You may not be motivated enough.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Everyone is different in this regard, and this website is designed to help you figure out exactly where your weaknesses are.</Text>

<View style={hr2}/>

<Text style={h2}>Change in attitude</Text>

<View style={hr2__bottom}/>







<Text style={p}>Embracing self-care requires a change in attitude.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Instead of thinking about our immediate wants, we need to begin thinking holistically and understand that cutting corners of any kind is going to result in future pain.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Certainly, costing us time and emotional stability in the long run.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Which exponentially increases the difficulty of everything else we hope to achieve, regardless of how much time we spend on those pursuits themselves.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Only by paying the maintanence tax can we ensure a) Our mental health remains intact and b) We achieve all our ambitions equally.</Text>

<Text style={p}>And that really is the key point people completely miss:</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>By respecting balance in our life, we can have everything we want without the compromise.</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>It simply requires respecting long-term outcomes, as opposed to hesitant, short-term outcomes.</Text>

<Text style={p}>The key takeaway from this article is that self-care exists above all, especially if you care about productivity.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Furthermore, that self-care is not optional.</Text>

<Text style={p}>It is a hard requirement and by avoiding self-care, we delay so many positive aspects of our life.</Text>
