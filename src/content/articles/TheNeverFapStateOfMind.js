          <Text style={h1}>The NeverFap State Of Mind</Text>
          

<Text style={p}>This article aims to explore the idea of what it means to have the mindset of someone who does NeverFap.</Text>

<Text style={p}>The thing I love most about NeverFap is that it&rsquo;s designed to make addressing your porn addiction easy.</Text>

<Text style={p}>On a very low level it&rsquo;s about learning to co-exist with your emotions, in order to both avoid experiencing porn cravings altogether, as well as remain neutral when they do arise.</Text>

<Text style={p}>And when you&rsquo;re not taking anything personally and you&rsquo;re not allowing any external influences from changing the way you think and feel&hellip;</Text>

<Text style={p}>Well, I couldn&rsquo;t possibly think of anything more effortless than that.</Text>

<Text style={p}>I truly believe that successful porn recovery requires an effortless approach in order to be effective, which is why I have designed NeverFap to be as effortless as possible.</Text>

<Text style={p}>If I had to use one word to describe what NeverFap encompasses.</Text>

<Text style={p}>I would use the word:</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>Calm.</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>Calm is the default NeverFap state of mind.</Text>

<Text style={p}>It&rsquo;s not about being excited, determined or ready to dominate the world with your new-found energy.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Those things will not help you sustainably overcome porn addiction.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Instead, it&rsquo;s about being calm.</Text>

<Text style={p}>When you practice the NeverFap Deluxe exercises everyday and apply them to your life, it makes you feel calm and collected.</Text>

<Text style={p}>In large part because when you practice these exercises which provide you with the required skills and abilities to control your mind, you no longer fear the unknown.</Text>

<View style={hr4}/>

<Text style={h4}>Because you know that you have a strategy in place, and you know exactly what to expect from your ability to address your addiction.</Text>

<View style={hr4__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>Another part of the reason why being calm and collected is important, is because it becomes really difficult to self-harm or react emotionally when you&rsquo;re feeling calm.</Text>

<Text style={p}>In fact, it becomes almost impossible.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Which is exactly what we want, and is part of the reason why calmness is so wonderful within itself.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>Because remaining calm doesn't require any effort.</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>In it&rsquo;s truest sense, calmness itself is a lack of effort.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Calmness is the result of letting go of all your thoughts and simply just being.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Ultimately, it&rsquo;s only possible not to be calm if you&rsquo;re actively doing something to disrupt it.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Whether it be obsessive thinking, feeling or judging - all these things serve to disrupt our default state of being calm.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Of course, you may struggle to remain calm because you&rsquo;ve built this habit of obsessively thinking and judging everything around you.</Text>

<Text style={p}>That&rsquo;s okay too.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>It's simply a matter of following your daily routine of NeverFap Deluxe Practices.</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>By commiting to meditation and practices which teach you self-control over your mind, you&rsquo;re making changes to how you think and feel.</Text>

<Text style={p}>And the longer you commit to practicing each and everyday.</Text>

<Text style={p}>The more you change and the closer you get to experiencing completely calmness in your life.</Text>

<Text style={p}>So what are you waiting for?</Text>

<Text style={p}>I recommend checking out our list of NeverFap Deluxe Practices for a list of exercises you can do to develop calmness in your life.</Text>
