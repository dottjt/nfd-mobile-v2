          <Text style={h1}>The Five Principles Of NeverFap As They Relate To My Life</Text>
          

<Text style={p}>To be quite honest, the five principles are quite arbitrary.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Which is to say that they&rsquo;re meaningless until you develop a personal understanding of how they apply to your own life.</Text>

<Text style={p}>While my article The Five Fundamental Principles of NeverFap is a good introduction into what they are, today I want to talk about what they actually mean in my own everyday life.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Because theory is one thing, however you may derive additional benefit from understanding how this theory applies to everyday situations.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Hopefully you can relate.</Text>


  <Text style={h2}>01 - Choice over mind</Text>


<Text style={p}>Choice over mind reminds me that I&rsquo;m always in control of myself.</Text>

<Text style={p}>It reminds me that I have the ability to control how I feel, control what I do, as well as control my reaction to life itself.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Essentially, it&rsquo;s a principle which gives me confidence over my porn addiction.</Text>

<Text style={p}>It gives me the confidence to understand that no matter what, I ultimately decide what my relationship with porn is.</Text>

<Text style={p}>I understand that if I struggle with porn, it&rsquo;s not because I&rsquo;ve lost control (in part because it&rsquo;s not possible to lose control, as opposed to simply making a bad decision).</Text>

<Text style={p}>But rather, because I&rsquo;m understanding some aspect of myself, which is causing me to struggle in some way.</Text>

<Text style={p}>In addition, having this understanding helps me not take my relationship with porn personally.</Text>

<Text style={p}>So in summary, Choice over mind helps me maintain that vital &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always got this&rdquo; mentality.</Text>


  <Text style={h2}>02 - Balance over reward</Text>


<Text style={p}>Balance over reward is perhaps the one principle I struggle with most.</Text>

<Text style={p}>As an entrepeneur of sorts, I&rsquo;m rather obsessed with getting stuff done. As a result, I tend to overwork myself and even worse, develop mania and obsession in order to maintain this productivity.</Text>

<Text style={p}>In other words, I struggle with bipolar disorder.</Text>

<Text style={p}>And let me tell you, it is almost impossible to overcome something like porn addiction, when your emotions are completely out of whack.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Yet, there is a solution.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Essentially, by embracing balance as a fundamental principle, I&rsquo;ve been able to avoid getting to a point of complete mania and obsession, and therefore not experience those highs and lows which derail long-term goals such as refraining from porn.</Text>

<Text style={p}>What does this entail?</Text>

<Text style={p}>Obviously, meditation helps significantly in terms of training my mind to be calm.</Text>

<Text style={p}>However I would say the biggest thing that helps is simply realising when I need to stop working.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Previously, I would continue working and writing up until before I had to go to bed, which would result in sleepless nights and would even result in &lsquo;coding nightmares&rsquo;.</Text>

<Text style={p}>What usually happens now on the other hand, is that I will simply stop doing any work around an hour and a half before bed, and that does a fine job of preventing mania and obsession from fully taking hold.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Sometimes I may still slip into mania if I&rsquo;ve been working particularly hard up until then, however the hour and a half is enough for me to calm down and switch my mind off.</Text>

<Text style={p}>During that time I usually stretch, meditate and relax (usually by playing video games or watching YouTube videos).</Text>

<Text style={p}>Initially it was really hard to stop myself from working.</Text>

<Text style={p}>In fact, the very idea of forcing myself to play video games and not work was something that I found hilarious, but I also knew that if I didn&rsquo;t relax, I&rsquo;d ultimately be doing my mental health a disservice.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Now that I have this balance in my life however, I have much more control over my emotions and my attitude towards productivity has changed.</Text>

<Text style={p}>I now realise that I am more productive by being balanced, and that I have more control over my life as a result.</Text>


  <Text style={h2}>03 - Awareness over all</Text>


<Text style={p}>I love being aware of my feelings and emotions.</Text>

<Text style={p}>It&rsquo;s like having a super power where you can instantly recognise what is happening within your head at any moment in time.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Awareness helps me with my porn addiction by allowing me to recognise behaviours and trends ahead of time, so I don&rsquo;t get stuck within them.</Text>

<Text style={p}>What this means for me is recognising what I should be paying attention to in different situations.</Text>

<Text style={p}>In that sense, Awareness is like that big brother which helps keep you together.</Text>

<Text style={p}>That thing which helps ground you and which allows you to default to a healthy coping mechanism, instead of splurging on porn and excess.</Text>

<Text style={p}>It is what allows me to always be in control, as well as remain calm and collected irregardless of what may be happening external to my brain.</Text>

<Text style={p}>For example, If I&rsquo;m on public transport and there are a lot of pretty women around, I remind myself that I just need to effortlessly relax and focus on myself.</Text>

<Text style={p}>If I&rsquo;m feeling stressed, I remind myself to time out and go for a walk.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Awareness is like a sedative that makes you more awake.</Text>

<Text style={p}>It is what helps me cope effortlessly when life is difficult, and I simply couldn&rsquo;t see myself not being a porn addict without it.</Text>


  <Text style={h2}>04 - Struggle over none</Text>


<Text style={p}>Struggle over none is all about understanding that which we misunderstand.</Text>

<Text style={p}>It&rsquo;s about understanding that we do have choice over what happens in life, and that there&rsquo;s no reason what-so-ever to take it personally when we feel out of control.</Text>

<Text style={p}>In other words, it&rsquo;s about having empathy for yourself.</Text>

<Text style={p}>We all have periods where we struggle.</Text>

<Text style={p}>We may be struggling with how to deal with others. We may be struggling with a difficult problem we&rsquo;ve been tasked to solve at work. We may even be struggling figure out the best way to address our emotions.</Text>

<Text style={p}>During these times, this principle is here to remind you:</Text>

<Text style={p}>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s totally fine. There&rsquo;s no reason to react. I fully accept what I&rsquo;m feeling as merely a by-product of misunderstanding, and there&rsquo;s nothing necessarily wrong with these negative feelings.&rdquo;</Text>

<Text style={p}>In contrast, my previous self would usually try to fight back.</Text>

<Text style={p}>I would fail to recognise my struggle as a misunderstanding, and instead I would assume it was because I wasn&rsquo;t trying hard enough, or because my emotions were becoming unmanagable.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Which would obviously make everything worse, eventually leading to relapse in some form.</Text>

<Text style={p}>When I struggle with my feelings and emotions now, I actually feel rather calm on some level.</Text>

<Text style={p}>I embrace and recognise those emotions as something not to take personally and I relax into them.</Text>

<Text style={p}>I don&rsquo;t take them personally, and I thank them for explaining to me that I&rsquo;m personally doing something incorrect which is causing me to feel this way.</Text>

<Text style={p}>After all, it&rsquo;s really hard to take something personally and react to it when you accept and acknowledge something for what it is.</Text>


  <Text style={h2}>05 - Uncondition over judgement</Text>


<Text style={p}>This is the principle most porn addicts generally struggle with at first.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Of course, being judgemental is not a problem specific to porn addiction itself, however it is certainly a strong contributor towards it.</Text>

<Text style={p}>In a sense, this principle is sort of the opposite to Awareness over all.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Because what judgements essentially do is take power away from your ability to be aware.</Text>

<Text style={p}>And it&rsquo;s impossible to observe and be aware of what is taking place in our minds, if your minds are constantly focusing on creating new thoughts and incessantly describing reality.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Certainly, I used to be a very judgemental person, often in ways that I didn&rsquo;t recognise as even being judgements.</Text>

<Text style={p}>For example, I used to incessantly scan women in public, trying to find attractive ones to obsess over.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Overtime I&rsquo;ve learnt not to judge at all, simply because I realise is serves no purpose in regards to cultivating my mental health.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Largely through meditation.</Text>
