<Text style={p}>There&rsquo;s one excuse that I often see porn addicts come up with in regards to their addiction.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>I don't have enough time.</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>Usually, it means time to spend towards addressing their porn addiction or mental health issues.</Text>

<Text style={p}>After all, we&rsquo;re all incredibly busy people. We have things to do. Ambitions to fulfil. I mean, what does any of this have to do with porn addiction?</Text>

<Text style={p}>It&rsquo;s an attitude which quite ironically, prevents us from actually focusing on what&rsquo;s important in life.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Which is why we&rsquo;re talking about it today.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>Because if you did have enough time to spend towards addressing your porn addiction, you simply wouldn't be a porn addict.</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>So what exactly does it mean to not have enough time?</Text>

<Text style={p}>Well, that&rsquo;s entirely up to you.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Maybe it&rsquo;s because you feel compelled to always be in a state of constant &ldquo;productivity&rdquo;, and that time spent working on your mental health doesn&rsquo;t seem productive.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Or perhaps, it&rsquo;s merely the feeling of productivity you crave.</Text>

<Text style={p}>For example, checking your phone every five minutes to see if someone&rsquo;s messaged you over Facebook.</Text>

<Text style={p}>On the otherhand, you may just be so obsessed with your goals and ambitions, that everything else which sits outside of those goals is seen as being irrelevant.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Regardless of your interpretation, I&rsquo;m here to tell you that thinking that you do not have enough time for your mental health is a disorder.</Text>

<Text style={p}>That is correct.</Text>

<View style={hr2}/>

<Text style={h2}>If you believe that you do not have enough time for your mental health then you have a mental disorder.</Text>

<View style={hr2__bottom}/>







<Text style={p}>It&rsquo;s a mental disorder because it&rsquo;s a choice to willingly neglect one&rsquo;s mental health, due to habit and desire.</Text>

<Text style={p}>And there are never any valid reasons why anyone should ever neglect their own mental health.</Text>

<Text style={p}>It&rsquo;s the most important thing you have, and it&rsquo;s incredibly difficult not to suffer when you don&rsquo;t have your mental health in order.</Text>

<Text style={p}>The moment you compromise on your mental health is when you introduce the potential to suffer.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Although perhaps you&rsquo;d rather suffer just to satisfy that feeling of productivity or get that extra bit further with your ambitions.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>Again, ask yourself how this mentality isn't a sign of having a disorder.</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>Part of this disorder consists of valuing time over quality of life.</Text>

<Text style={p}>So a question worth asking is:</Text>

<Text style={p}><Text style={{textDecoration: "underline"}}><b>What is time without your mental health?</b></Text></Text>

<Text style={p}>Without mental health, time becomes an uncontrollable struggle of judgement, self-criticism and depression.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Instead of having control over what we think and feel, we instead find ourselves taking everything personally and feeling helpless to absolutely everything in our life.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Without our mental health, days may seem like years in situations we largely find unbearable, which has the possibility to become any situation because that is no longer for us to decide.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Without our mental health, life becomes very difficult.</Text>

<View style={hr4}/>

<Text style={h4}>Of course, there's a reason why poor mental health is often described as a self-repeating cycle.</Text>

<View style={hr4__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>We choose to obsess over something which we believe will make us happy i.e. addiction, uncheked ambitions etc.</Text>

<Text style={p}>We worship that activity with our effort and time, believing it will make us feel better about ourselves.</Text>

<Text style={p}>We end up feeling empty once the obsession wears off, inspite of all the time we spent believing in these solutions.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Then we go and repeat the cycle again and again and again.</Text>

<View style={hr2}/>

<Text style={h2}>And to be honest, it's a bit shit.</Text>

<View style={hr2__bottom}/>







<Text style={p}>I&rsquo;m sure you think so too.</Text>

<Text style={p}>All because we don&rsquo;t believe we have enough time to actually commit to something which will know will improve our frame of mind.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Although perhaps you don&rsquo;t really see the point to doing things which may or may not improve your mental well-being.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Certainly, I don&rsquo;t blame you.</Text>

<Text style={p}>It&rsquo;s hard to evaluate anything when your emotions are completely out of whack, and you genuinely believe that pursuing the same behaviours again and again will truly be &ldquo;different this time&rdquo; despite producing the exact same results of hope and depression in what seems to be a never ending cycle.</Text>

<View style={hr4}/>

<Text style={h4}>But let me say that there's never a bad time to commit to your mental health.</Text>

<View style={hr4__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>One key thing to understand about mental health is that it&rsquo;s accumulative.</Text>

<Text style={p}>And the true beauty of mental health is that everything you&rsquo;ve done up until now to negatively impact your mental health is completely irrelevant.</Text>

<Text style={p}><Text style={{textDecoration: "underline"}}><Text style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>For the only thing which truly matters is that which you do today.</Text></Text></Text>

<Text style={p}>Ultimately, it&rsquo;s about focusing on what you can do today, and this is the key to breaking this habit of never committing to your mental health.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Realising that mental health isn&rsquo;t achieved by what you don&rsquo;t do, but rather by what you can do today.</Text>



<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>Honestly, spending ten minutes at night before bed meditating is all most people need.</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>Ultimately, however.</Text>

<Text style={p}>If you don&rsquo;t truly believe or understand why your mental health is more important than anything else in your life.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Then you&rsquo;re going to continue to pursue activities which will conflict with your mental health.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Just remember that whatever other things you achieve in place of your mental health, can never replace mental health itself.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Which is to say that your achievements outside of mental health will never serve as a true solution to your problems.</Text>

<Text style={p}>And when you do decide to work on your mental health, you may very well discover that everything you&rsquo;ve pursued up until then has been utterly pointless.</Text>

<View style={hr2}/>

<Text style={h2}>From this point of view, you have nothing to gain from neglecting your mental health.</Text>

<View style={hr2__bottom}/>







<Text style={p}>No matter what other benefits those other achievements may provide.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Because in the overall scheme of things, your mental health is what determines how you feel, not your achievements.</Text>

<Text style={p}>So in the overall scheme of things, 10 minutes, or even an hour a day spent working on your mental health is miniscule, compared to the benefits it will provide in helping you better understand yourself.</Text>
