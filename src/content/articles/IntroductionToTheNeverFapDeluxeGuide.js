<Text style={p}>Today I’m here to talk to you about porn addiction.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Porn addiction itself can be a very complex topic. We can spend hours discussing the intricacies of how particular cultural upbringings affect the way we view women.</Text>

<Text style={p}>We can bore over the details of our past trauma in order to extract why exactly we’re so obsessed with certain types of porn.</Text>

<Text style={p}>We can do all sorts of things to try and understand why we humans are the way we are, and to be quite frank&hellip; it’s all very exhausting.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Because the truth is, overcoming pornography addiction is deceptively simple.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>From a process point of view, I spend around 40 minutes each day practicing meditation.</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>And that’s literally all I need to maintain control over my mind.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Of course, I also do a lot more, like train my mind with perspective exercises, but now that I&rsquo;m in a stable state in regards to my porn addiction, all I really have do is maintain my mental health.</Text>

<Text style={p}>I now no longer think about porn. No longer do I crave porn. I wouldn’t even want to masturbate to porn if you put it in front of me.</Text>

<Text style={p}>It&rsquo;s just not how my mind works anymore.</Text>

<Text style={p}>And it&rsquo;s so empowering.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>The point is that overcoming porn addiction is totally achievable.</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>And I want to show you how.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Ultimately, we have one rule here at NeverFap:</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>Practice. Practice. Practice.</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>Without practicing the core skills that will help you overcome porn addiction, you simply cannot overcome porn addiction. I don&rsquo;t know how else to say it.</Text>

<Text style={p}>It&rsquo;s no different whether you want to become a successful body builder or a world class sculptor. Practice is the bridge that will help get you there.</Text>

<Text style={p}>You know it. I know it. Everyone knows it.</Text>

<Text style={p}>So what&rsquo;s stopping you?</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>Cravings. Fear. Doubt. Anxiety. Addiction.</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>Which is to say there&rsquo;s some kind of internal misunderstanding which is preventing you from doing what you want in your mind.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Yes, a misunderstanding.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Perhaps it&rsquo;s a self-limiting belief. Perhaps you haven&rsquo;t developed your awareness to a point that you can act with intention. Perhaps you have no idea what you&rsquo;re doing.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Perhaps you&rsquo;ve never developed a single healthy coping mechanism at all in your entire life.</Text>

<Text style={p}>That&rsquo;s why I came up with The Five Fundamental Principles of NeverFap in order to help you better understand where you may be misunderstanding yourself.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>Otherwise, known as denial.</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>If we had to break down what people tend to find difficult in regards to overcoming their porn addiction.</Text>

<Text style={p}>You could say that it comes down to a) Figuring out how to actually convince oneself to commit to porn recovery and b) Truly understanding what will work, and what will not.</Text>

<Text style={p}>This not only includes the knowledge surrounding porn recovery, but also working with our emotions to effectively apply it in everyday situations.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Which can be incredibly difficult, if not outright confusing when we don&rsquo;t truly have the confidence to know exactly what we&rsquo;re doing.</Text>

<Text style={p}>We&rsquo;ll be feeling completely confident one week into our recovery, only to face what seems like an insurmountable wall of fear and doubt, which inevitably leads to relpase.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>Well, that’s why I decided to create NeverFap Deluxe.</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>My intention is to help you fill in all the gaps, so you don’t have to run around like a headless chook, the same way that I did for five years.</Text>

<Text style={p}>In this website, I hope to talk about every single aspect of how to successfully become porn free. What you’ll need to learn. How you can learn those things. How not to fall into certain traps.</Text>

<Text style={p}>How it&rsquo;s actually an incredibly straight-forward process if you just follow the motions.</Text>

<Text style={p}>I want to teach and explain all the core skills that I have come to learn over the past five years over My Personal Porn Recovery Journey, and I want to go into detail as to what these skills and understandings are.</Text>

<Text style={p}>As for a non-exhaustive list of these skills, here are some of the things which you will learn which will help you overcome porn addiction:</Text>

<View style={hrul}/>

<View style={ul}>
<Text style={li}>Learn to focus on the how, not the why.</Text>
<Text style={li}>Learn to value your mental health above all.</Text>
<Text style={li}>Develop the ability to quiet and focus your mind.</Text>
<Text style={li}>Learn to love and accept yourself and others unconditionally.</Text>
<Text style={li}>Learn to invest in yourself.</Text>
<Text style={li}>Change the way you think about sex and women.</Text>
<Text style={li}>Value commitment and long-term thinking.</Text>
<Text style={li}>Identify and understanding any potential mental disorders.</Text>
<Text style={li}>Properly understand how to live life without porn.</Text>
</View>

<View style={hrul__bottom}/>

<Text style={p}>I explore each of these aspects (and more) in detail, as well as why they are so crucial for in regards to successfully overcoming porn addiction.</Text>

<View style={hr4}/>

<Text style={h4}>Personally speaking it took me around 5 years of trial and error before everything finally clicked in my head.</Text>

<View style={hr4__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>And I’m now at a point where porn has no control over me.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Realistically, you could probably achieve the same thing in around six months if you stuck to a rigorous routine.</Text>

<Text style={p}>However, I also maintain that humans simply aren’t like that.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Some of us are driven by failure and by experiencing things the hard way. Others of us may be so deep in our delusion that it may take years to even realise that we have a problem.</Text>

<Text style={p}>That’s okay too.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Understand that we’re not here to fight ourselves any longer.</Text>

<Text style={p}>We’re here to understand who we are, what we have to do to change, as well as understand how we can improve as people.</Text>
