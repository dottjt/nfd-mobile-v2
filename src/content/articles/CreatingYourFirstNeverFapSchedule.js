<Text style={p}>Everything in life revolves around practice.</Text>

<Text style={p}>No matter what you want to do in life, practice is the means through which we master something.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>Practice is what will allow us to overcome porn addiction.</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>And what you practice is absolutely vital.</Text>

<Text style={p}>In the case of overcoming porn addiction, this means practicing the core skills involved to help you regain control over your mind.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Anything else you practice outside of this, will not meaningfully impact your porn addiction in the same way that having control over your mind will.</Text>

<Text style={p}>And the only way this is going to happen, is if you have an effective routine of practice in place.</Text>

<Text style={p}>This means understanding why these practices are effective, finding the time to actually practice them and most importantly, doing these practices consistently.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>To start out, I recommend spending approximately 10 minutes per day practicing observation.</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>Specifically, the Observe Your Senses practice which explains how to do this in the most simple way possible.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Observation truly is the most fundamental practice you can do in terms of  developing your awarenes, and it is the practice we ask that you commit to every single day.</Text>

<Text style={p}>In part because observation should form the fundamental basis of everything you do.</Text>

<Text style={p}>From how you think to how you perceive the world around you.</Text>

<View style={hr2}/>

<Text style={h2}>It's more-or-less the only exercise I personally do.</Text>

<View style={hr2__bottom}/>







<Text style={p}>In part because I&rsquo;ve already spent years doing all those other practices, and they&rsquo;re now less meaningful now that they&rsquo;re engrained into my head.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Whereas because observation is what I would consider &ldquo;a default state of mind&rdquo; is something which we need to continually develop on a daily basis.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Certainly, while those other practices are incredibly useful in developing new perspectives, they are merely supplementary.</Text>

<Text style={p}>The aim is that once you feel you have a grasp of Observe Your Senses, you can start adding additional exercises to your routine.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>Personally speaking, I don't recommend doing more than one additional exercise at a time.</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>Which is to say that an ideal routine will consist of doing <Text style={{textDecoration: "underline"}}>Observe Your Senses</Text> along with one other additional exercise.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Usually it makes sense to commit to these additional exercises for a week, before switching to something else.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Just because doing it only for a day, won&rsquo;t teach us very much in terms of how changing the way we think will truly affect us long-term.</Text>

<Text style={p}>But of course, finding out what personally works for you is important as well.</Text>

<View style={hr2}/>

<Text style={h2}>My Personal NeverFap Routine</Text>

<View style={hr2__bottom}/>







<Text style={p}>I have a very basic routine which works really well for me.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Essentially, I spend around 40 minutes each day towards developing my awareness.</Text>

<Text style={p}>With a few small key points throughout the day where I periodically zone out and just embrace calm.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Here&rsquo;s how I would break it down:</Text>

<View style={hrul}/>

<View style={ul}>
<Text style={li}><b>15 minutes of meditation as I walk to the train station in the morning for work.</b></Text>
<Text style={li}><b>15 minutes of meditation as I walk to the train station in the morning for work.</b></Text>
<Text style={li}><b>10 minutes of meditation while sitting down in a room, around 15 minutes before bed.</b></Text>
</View>

<View style={hrul__bottom}/>

<Text style={p}>This is the routine that I personally find works superbly well for me, in part because I don&rsquo;t need to necessarily go out of my way to make it happen.</Text>

<Text style={p}>I&rsquo;ve simply adapted meditation to my everyday life, and that&rsquo;s what I recommend you do as well.</Text>

<Text style={p}>In almost all cases, I am practicising observation of some kind, although usually encompassing different variations.</Text>

<Text style={p}>I may focus on a very particular sense.</Text>

<Text style={p}>In other cases, I may simply focus on emptying the thoughts from my mind.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>Regardless, I keep it super simple and that's why it works.</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>Another thing to consider is self-care.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Ultimately, the reason why NeverFap works as a solution is because the core philosophy behind it is quite simple.</Text>

<Text style={p}>And self-care is simply another aspect we can focus on, to make things even simpler.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Certainly, this isn&rsquo;t a focus of this website, so you can certainly do your own research into this.</Text>

<Text style={p}>However below is a list of what I personally do to maintain self-care in my life.</Text>

<View style={hrul}/>

<View style={ul}>
<Text style={li}>I eat paleo.</Text>
<Text style={li}>I do cardio and lift weights three times a week.</Text>
<Text style={li}>I have a consistent sleep routine.</Text>
<Text style={li}>I work on my hobbies and ambitions in my spare time.</Text>
<Text style={li}>I play video games and watch TV to relax.</Text>
<Text style={li}>I meditate approximately three times a day.</Text>
<Text style={li}>I work a typical nine-to-five job.</Text>
<Text style={li}>I brush my teeth in the morning and at night.</Text>
<Text style={li}>I have a cold shower every night.</Text>
</View>

<View style={hrul__bottom}/>

<Text style={p}>The extent to which you maintain self-care is entirely up to you.</Text>

<Text style={p}>In any case, I hope this post has helped you better understand what you can expect from a consistent never</Text>

<Text style={p}>I encourage you to start small and simply commit to 10 minutes of meditation each day.</Text>

<Text style={p}>That&rsquo;s precisely how I started and to be quite honest, spending 10 minutes each day was enough for me to see significant changes in the way I thought over the space of a few weeks.</Text>

<Text style={p}>So don&rsquo;t feel as if you need to commit all your time to doing this.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Remember, it&rsquo;s not how much you practice that counts, but what you practice that matters.</Text>

<Text style={p}>In particular, if you feel as if you&rsquo;re struggling to find time to commit to your mental health, I highly recommend reading my article You Always Have Time For Your Mental Health</Text>
