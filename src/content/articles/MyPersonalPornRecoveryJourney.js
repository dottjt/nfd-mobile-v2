          <Text style={h1}>My Personal Porn Recovery Journey</Text>
          

<Text style={p}>I came across porn at a very young age.</Text>

<Text style={p}>I started watching porn from the very moment I figured out how to physically masturbate at the age of 10.</Text>

<Text style={p}>And I&rsquo;m sure your story is quite similar.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Discovering porn as a kid is like discovering Bitcoin as a young adult.</Text>

<Text style={p}>It&rsquo;s this absurd hyper-fantasy that sucks you in and I really don&rsquo;t need to go into the details. I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re more than familiar with what it means to be someone who watches porn on a regular basis.</Text>

<Text style={p}>It sucks.</Text>

<Text style={p}>I&rsquo;m not exactly sure when I decided that I wanted to give up porn, but I suppose there have been a variety of serious attempts through out my life.</Text>

<Text style={p}>My very first attempt at giving up porn began at age 16, where I thought I&rsquo;d try to give up porn for the hell of it.</Text>

<Text style={p}>You know, because you&rsquo;re only ever 16 once, and I wanted to experience what 16 year old me could achieve.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Overall I managed to abstain for approximately 3 weeks, until collapsing into a puddle of sweat and binge-mania.</Text>

<Text style={p}>It then wasn&rsquo;t until I was around 20 years old that I began to recognise that porn was an actual problem in my life, if not from the simple perspective of being an addict.</Text>

<Text style={p}>A problem which I was determined to understand and overcome.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>Age 25. October 20th 2018.</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>The last time in my entire life that I will have ever masturbated to, or ever watched porn.</Text>

<Text style={p}>A commitment that I have upheld until today, rather effortlessly.</Text>

<Text style={p}>You know when you have that moment when everything clicks, and absolutely everything comes together and makes sense?</Text>

<Text style={p}>I was the guy who had that moment, and I&rsquo;ve been in control of myself ever since.</Text>

<Text style={p}>If I had to detail all the changes that occurred within that five year period, we&rsquo;d literally be here all day.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Because, you know.</Text>

<Text style={p}>A lot changes over the five year span of anyone&rsquo;s life, and the best we can do is look back in retrospect and identify the things that went right.</Text>

<Text style={p}>So up until then, here&rsquo;s what I was doing right:</Text>

<View style={hrul}/>

<View style={ul}>
<Text style={li}>Done the whole Paleo diet thing</Text>
<Text style={li}>Studied various books and perspective course on mental health</Text>
<Text style={li}>Took cold showers everyday before bed</Text>
<Text style={li}>Ate only one meal a day (via intermittent fasting)</Text>
<Text style={li}>Was doing Leangains and lifting weights three times a week</Text>
<Text style={li}>Was in an amazing, supportive relationship</Text>
<Text style={li}>Worked obscenely hard to get a job as a programmer</Text>
</View>

<View style={hrul__bottom}/>

<Text style={p}>Truth was, I was doing almost everything right.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Yet none of that actually mattered, because it was those small things that I wasn&rsquo;t doing, which made the other 90% of my effort null.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Today I want to share what those things are with you are, and why they were arguably more important than anything I&rsquo;d done up until then.</Text>

<Text style={p}>I suppose there were two main things that happened, which helped me better understand exactly what I had to do to address my porn addiction.</Text>

<Text style={p}>And it all happened within the space of a few weeks.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>For starters I had a breakdown.</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>You see, I suffer from a condition from Bipolar Disorder, and it was something I hadn&rsquo;t told my partner about.</Text>

<Text style={p}>In part, because I just assumed she already knew, but primarily because I&rsquo;m not the kind of person who will ask for help from others.</Text>

<Text style={p}>However, one day I was feeling particularly vulnerable and I realised one very important thing, which I maintain is important to this day:</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>It's impossible to do it alone.</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>The reason why you break down is because for most people, it&rsquo;s almost impossible to admit that you have a problem, and so mentally you just turn to jelly.</Text>

<Text style={p}>At first, she didn&rsquo;t take it seriously.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Because I&rsquo;d never mentioned it once in our 4 year relationship. But when it kicked in that it was actually something I was hiding from her this whole time, it made a lot of sense.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Ultimately, a few things happened as a result.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Now that she was aware of my disorder, I was now able to be honest about all the things I was hiding from her. In particular, my porn addiction which was in part a coping mechanism for my Bipolar.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>Which as a result, gave me this surreal confidence to actually address my porn addiction.</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>For whatever reason, when you get everything off your chest, it just completely changes everything.</Text>

<Text style={p}>You no longer feel guilt for who you are and you no longer see yourself as a monster.</Text>

<Text style={p}>You merely see your actions as a symptom of something greater, which allows you to not take them personally, and not react to them negatively.</Text>

<Text style={p}>In addition, it also meant that I could ask for help and support when required. I could tell her that I was struggling with my porn addiction, and not feel judged or vindicated.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Understanding and recognising my disorder, which I&rsquo;d previously dismissed, helped me better understand my emotions and therefore, manage them a lot more easily.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>I finally felt free to just move on with my life.</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>And it&rsquo;s impossible to understate what that feels like.</Text>

<Text style={p}>The second thing which happened, which came about in large part due to my breakdown and coming out about my Bipolar, was equally if not more profound in terms of addressing my porn addiction.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>Essentially, I'd discovered this thing called meditation.</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>The funny thing about meditation is that I&rsquo;d tried doing it through out various phases of my life to no avail.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Or perhaps all that effort had accumulated up until then, I&rsquo;m not entirely sure.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Regardless, up until then I&rsquo;d failed to see the value in the meditation.</Text>

<Text style={p}>However following my break down, I&rsquo;d decided to take my mental health seriously, and I was determined to do everything in my power to get better.</Text>

<Text style={p}>A friend at work had mentioned the benefits of meditation in his life, as well as a popular guided meditation course which he swore his life by.</Text>

<Text style={p}>So I decided to do this course, which was basically a 10 minute commitment before bed each day, and my gosh.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>I can happily say that within two weeks of meditating I'd learnt more about how to manage my porn addiction than in absolutely everything I've done in the past five years to try and curb my addiction.</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>All because of a simple 10 minute practice before bed.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Absolutely incredible.</Text>

<Text style={p}>The primary reason for this is because meditating allowed me to effectively control and manage my emotions</Text>

<Text style={p}>Primarily, the practice of meditation provided me with the ability to fully control my mind, something which I hadn&rsquo;t experienced before.</Text>

<Text style={p}>It allowed me to relax my mind at will. To prevent incessant thinking and most importantly, not take my emotions and what I was feeling personally.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>If I had one piece of advice to anyone wanting to seriously overcome their porn addiction, it would be to start meditating today.</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>It is possibly the most essential thing you can do to assist you in overcoming porn addiction.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Of course, what&rsquo;s also important is how you meditate, and that&rsquo;s precisely what I cover in this website.</Text>

<Text style={p}>For example, a form of meditation I personally find incredibly useful is walking in public, and simply avoiding placing our attention on people walking past us.</Text>

<View style={hr2}/>

<Text style={h2}>The next steps in my journey</Text>

<View style={hr2__bottom}/>







<Text style={p}>Now that I&rsquo;ve managed to successfully overcome porn addiction, I want to help you do the same.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Often the best way to learn something is to teach others how to do that same thing, and so that&rsquo;s what I want to do with NeverFap.</Text>

<Text style={p}>To create a vibrant resource for other porn addicts to learn from, so we no longer have to struggle and cause harm in life due to the effects of addiction.</Text>
