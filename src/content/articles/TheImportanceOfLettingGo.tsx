        <Text style={p}>Some people have a difficult time letting go.</Text>

<Text style={p}>For example, some people will continue to latch onto negative feelings, regardless of whether these feelings are productive, let alone help us feel empowered about who who we are.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Others have a hard time letting go of their own thoughts, as they find themselves paralyzed in indecision, stuck in a cycle of incessant rationality and self-judgement.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Failure to let go may even extend to the toxic people in our lives, or even the self-limiting beliefs we have about ourselves, that we&rsquo;re simply &ldquo;not good enough&rdquo; or &ldquo;undeserving&rdquo; of love and attention.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Regardless of what it is we&rsquo;re struggling with, the solution all points to the same thing.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>Learning to let go and learning to become free of these unproductive attributes.</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>Of course, if it were as simple as walking away, none of us would have any problems and we&rsquo;d all be clear of our addiction and a-ok to continue with our lives.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Well, today I&rsquo;m here to discuss not only the importance of letting go, but also how you can achieve this purpose by changing the way we think about attachment.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Part of the reason why people struggle with letting go, is because there&rsquo;s a great fear and misunderstanding surrounding this idea of what letting go truly is.</Text>

<Text style={p}>At first glance people will usually assume the worst.</Text>

<Text style={p}>They&rsquo;ll view letting go as this process of inherently losing something.</Text>

<Text style={p}>In particular, losing a part of themselves that they believe to be not only valuable, but irreplaceable.</Text>

<Text style={p}>A part of themselves which they&rsquo;ve contributed towards for so long, that they can no longer distinguish between themselves from &lsquo;it&rsquo;.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Under these circumstances, letting go then becomes this deep-seated fear of loss, potentially leaving this hollow shell of nothingness which we may end up regretting.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>Well, I'm here to tell you that this makes no sense what-so-ever.</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>You see, you don&rsquo;t actually lose anything by letting go.</Text>

<Text style={p}>There is no &lsquo;void&rsquo; once something leaves.</Text>

<Text style={p}>If you think of the conscious human experience as a bunch of brain waves moving forward, those waves don&rsquo;t suddenly disappear the moment you let something go.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Nor do you experience less waves, nor more.</Text>

<Text style={p}>The only time this ever happens is when you die, and since you&rsquo;re still very much alive and conscious once you let go, nothing is even lost in a metaphysical sense.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Those brain waves will still keep chugging along at the same rate as they did prior to when you didn&rsquo;t let go.</Text>

<Text style={p}>So what actually happens then?</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>Well, what happens is that it allows you to experience different waves.</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>Much like those brain waves which are being produced each second, it can help to think of the brain as a conveyor belt in an ice-cream factory.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Regardless of which flavour of ice-cream you decide to produce, that conveyor belt is still going to be producing ice-cream none-the-less.</Text>

<Text style={p}>If you think of all the awful things in your life as terrible flavours of ice-cream, then letting go of them isn&rsquo;t going to suddenly stop producing ice-cream.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Instead, what happens is quite remarkable.</Text>

<Text style={p}>What happens is that you begin producing neutral, vanilla ice-cream.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Not worse ice-cream, just normal, plain ice-cream.</Text>

<Text style={p}>And you know what? Plain ice-cream tastes a hell of a lot better than bad ice-cream.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Which is to say that by letting go of those awful flavours, you essentially allow yourself the opportuinty to start from scratch and create new amazing ones.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Put simply, you can&rsquo;t make great ice-cream from crap ice-cream.</Text>

<Text style={p}>You need to start with neutral base and that&rsquo;s essentially what letting go provides.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>What people don't realise is that letting go is in fact an opportunity.</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>It&rsquo;s an opportunity to experience something new. Something exciting. Something magical.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Of course, half the challenge is that people remain so devoid of experiencing anything nice, that they therefore assume that these &lsquo;non-awful&rsquo; experiences simply don&rsquo;t exist.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Well, they do - as long as you change your understanding of loss and fear in relation to letting go, as I&rsquo;ve mentioned in this article.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Often what can help is to simply commit to the process without expectation. A lot of the time that&rsquo;s how I approach my gym workouts.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Because sometimes feelings simply disagree. Sometimes you don&rsquo;t feel like working out, but that doesn&rsquo;t denote the importance of why you should be working out consistently.</Text>

<Text style={p}>So how do you effectively let go?</Text>

<Text style={p}>Well, like anything in life, it simply comes down to a matter of practice and consistency.</Text>

<Text style={p}>There are quite a few exercises in our practices section of the NeverFap Deluxe website, which are designed to help dissolve your ego.</Text>

<Text style={p}>And help you dissociate from your thoughts and feelings, so your ability to enact conscsious action can be exercised in full.</Text>

<Text style={p}><Text style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>What Can Your Hand Do?</Text> and <Text style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>Stop Absolutely Everything You&rsquo;re Doing</Text> are good places to start for most people, although each exercise provides a different focus.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Essentially, anything which can help you challenge that feeling of obligation you have not to let go, can certainly help on a cognitive and mental level.</Text>

<Text style={p}>So get crackin&rsquo; buddy. Your mental health won&rsquo;t sort itself out without you.</Text>
