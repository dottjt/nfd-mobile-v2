        <Text style={p}>
          Today I’m here to talk to you about porn addiction.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Porn addiction itself can be a very complex topic. We can spend hours
          discussing the intricacies of how particular cultural upbringings
          affect the way we view women.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          We can bore over the details of our past trauma in order to extract
          why exactly we’re so obsessed with certain types of porn.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          We can do all sorts of things to try and understand why we humans are
          the way we are, and to be quite frank&hellip; it’s all very
          exhausting.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Because the truth is, overcoming pornography addiction is deceptively
          simple.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>
          From a process point of view, I spend around 40 minutes each day
          practicing meditation.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          And that’s literally all I need to maintain control over my mind.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Of course, I also do a lot more, like train my mind with perspective
          exercises, but now that I&rsquo;m in a stable state in regards to my
          porn addiction, all I really have do is maintain my mental health.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          I now no longer think about porn. No longer do I crave porn. I
          wouldn’t even want to masturbate to porn if you put it in front of me.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>It&rsquo;s just not how my mind works anymore.</Text>

        <Text style={p}>And it&rsquo;s so empowering.</Text>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>
          The point is that overcoming porn addiction is totally achievable.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>And I want to show you how.</Text>

        <Text style={p}>Ultimately, we have one rule here at NeverFap:</Text>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>Practice. Practice. Practice.</Text>

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          Without practicing the core skills that will help you overcome porn
          addiction, you simply cannot overcome porn addiction. I don&rsquo;t
          know how else to say it.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          It&rsquo;s no different whether you want to become a successful body
          builder or a world class sculptor. Practice is the bridge that will
          help get you there.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>You know it. I know it. Everyone knows it.</Text>

        <Text style={p}>So what&rsquo;s stopping you?</Text>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>Cravings. Fear. Doubt. Anxiety. Addiction.</Text>

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          Which is to say there&rsquo;s some kind of internal misunderstanding
          which is preventing you from doing what you want in your mind.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>Yes, a misunderstanding.</Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Perhaps it&rsquo;s a self-limiting belief. Perhaps you haven&rsquo;t
          developed your awareness to a point that you can act with intention.
          Perhaps you have no idea what you&rsquo;re doing.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Perhaps you&rsquo;ve never developed a single healthy coping mechanism
          at all in your entire life.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          That&rsquo;s why I came up with The Five Fundamental Principles of
          NeverFap in order to help you better understand where you may be
          misunderstanding yourself.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>Otherwise, known as denial.</Text>

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          If we had to break down what people tend to find difficult in regards
          to overcoming their porn addiction.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          You could say that it comes down to a) Figuring out how to actually
          convince oneself to commit to porn recovery and b) Truly understanding
          what will work, and what will not.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          This not only includes the knowledge surrounding porn recovery, but
          also working with our emotions to effectively apply it in everyday
          situations.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Which can be incredibly difficult, if not outright confusing when we
          don&rsquo;t truly have the confidence to know exactly what we&rsquo;re
          doing.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          We&rsquo;ll be feeling completely confident one week into our
          recovery, only to face what seems like an insurmountable wall of fear
          and doubt, which inevitably leads to relpase.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>
          Well, that’s why I decided to create NeverFap Deluxe.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          My intention is to help you fill in all the gaps, so you don’t have to
          run around like a headless chook, the same way that I did for five
          years.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          In this website, I hope to talk about every single aspect of how to
          successfully become porn free. What you’ll need to learn. How you can
          learn those things. How not to fall into certain traps.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          How it&rsquo;s actually an incredibly straight-forward process if you
          just follow the motions.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          I want to teach and explain all the core skills that I have come to
          learn over the past five years over My Personal Porn Recovery Journey,
          and I want to go into detail as to what these skills and
          understandings are.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          As for a non-exhaustive list of these skills, here are some of the
          things which you will learn which will help you overcome porn
          addiction:
        </Text>

        <View style={hrul} />

        <View style={ul}>
          <Text style={li}>Learn to focus on the how, not the why.</Text>
          <Text style={li}>Learn to value your mental health above all.</Text>
          <Text style={li}>
            Develop the ability to quiet and focus your mind.
          </Text>
          <Text style={li}>
            Learn to love and accept yourself and others unconditionally.
          </Text>
          <Text style={li}>Learn to invest in yourself.</Text>
          <Text style={li}>Change the way you think about sex and women.</Text>
          <Text style={li}>Value commitment and long-term thinking.</Text>
          <Text style={li}>
            Identify and understanding any potential mental disorders.
          </Text>
          <Text style={li}>
            Properly understand how to live life without porn.
          </Text>
        </View>

        <View style={hrul__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          I explore each of these aspects (and more) in detail, as well as why
          they are so crucial for in regards to successfully overcoming porn
          addiction.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr4} />

        <Text style={h4}>
          Personally speaking it took me around 5 years of trial and error
          before everything finally clicked in my head.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr4__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          And I’m now at a point where porn has no control over me.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Realistically, you could probably achieve the same thing in around six
          months if you stuck to a rigorous routine.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          However, I also maintain that humans simply aren’t like that.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Some of us are driven by failure and by experiencing things the hard
          way. Others of us may be so deep in our delusion that it may take
          years to even realise that we have a problem.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>That’s okay too.</Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Understand that we’re not here to fight ourselves any longer.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          We’re here to understand who we are, what we have to do to change, as
          well as understand how we can improve as people.

        <Text style={h1}>My Personal Porn Recovery Journey</Text>

        <Text style={p}>I came across porn at a very young age.</Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          I started watching porn from the very moment I figured out how to
          physically masturbate at the age of 10.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>And I&rsquo;m sure your story is quite similar.</Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Discovering porn as a kid is like discovering Bitcoin as a young
          adult.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          It&rsquo;s this absurd hyper-fantasy that sucks you in and I really
          don&rsquo;t need to go into the details. I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re
          more than familiar with what it means to be someone who watches porn
          on a regular basis.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>It sucks.</Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          I&rsquo;m not exactly sure when I decided that I wanted to give up
          porn, but I suppose there have been a variety of serious attempts
          through out my life.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          My very first attempt at giving up porn began at age 16, where I
          thought I&rsquo;d try to give up porn for the hell of it.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          You know, because you&rsquo;re only ever 16 once, and I wanted to
          experience what 16 year old me could achieve.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Overall I managed to abstain for approximately 3 weeks, until
          collapsing into a puddle of sweat and binge-mania.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          It then wasn&rsquo;t until I was around 20 years old that I began to
          recognise that porn was an actual problem in my life, if not from the
          simple perspective of being an addict.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          A problem which I was determined to understand and overcome.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>Age 25. October 20th 2018.</Text>

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          The last time in my entire life that I will have ever masturbated to,
          or ever watched porn.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          A commitment that I have upheld until today, rather effortlessly.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          You know when you have that moment when everything clicks, and
          absolutely everything comes together and makes sense?
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          I was the guy who had that moment, and I&rsquo;ve been in control of
          myself ever since.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          If I had to detail all the changes that occurred within that five year
          period, we&rsquo;d literally be here all day.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>Because, you know.</Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          A lot changes over the five year span of anyone&rsquo;s life, and the
          best we can do is look back in retrospect and identify the things that
          went right.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          So up until then, here&rsquo;s what I was doing right:
        </Text>

        <View style={hrul} />

        <View style={ul}>
          <Text style={li}>Done the whole Paleo diet thing</Text>
          <Text style={li}>
            Studied various books and perspective course on mental health
          </Text>
          <Text style={li}>Took cold showers everyday before bed</Text>
          <Text style={li}>
            Ate only one meal a day (via intermittent fasting)
          </Text>
          <Text style={li}>
            Was doing Leangains and lifting weights three times a week
          </Text>
          <Text style={li}>Was in an amazing, supportive relationship</Text>
          <Text style={li}>
            Worked obscenely hard to get a job as a programmer
          </Text>
        </View>

        <View style={hrul__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>Truth was, I was doing almost everything right.</Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Yet none of that actually mattered, because it was those small things
          that I wasn&rsquo;t doing, which made the other 90% of my effort null.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Today I want to share what those things are with you are, and why they
          were arguably more important than anything I&rsquo;d done up until
          then.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          I suppose there were two main things that happened, which helped me
          better understand exactly what I had to do to address my porn
          addiction.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          And it all happened within the space of a few weeks.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>For starters I had a breakdown.</Text>

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          You see, I suffer from a condition from Bipolar Disorder, and it was
          something I hadn&rsquo;t told my partner about.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          In part, because I just assumed she already knew, but primarily
          because I&rsquo;m not the kind of person who will ask for help from
          others.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          However, one day I was feeling particularly vulnerable and I realised
          one very important thing, which I maintain is important to this day:
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>It's impossible to do it alone.</Text>

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          The reason why you break down is because for most people, it&rsquo;s
          almost impossible to admit that you have a problem, and so mentally
          you just turn to jelly.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>At first, she didn&rsquo;t take it seriously.</Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Because I&rsquo;d never mentioned it once in our 4 year relationship.
          But when it kicked in that it was actually something I was hiding from
          her this whole time, it made a lot of sense.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>Ultimately, a few things happened as a result.</Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Now that she was aware of my disorder, I was now able to be honest
          about all the things I was hiding from her. In particular, my porn
          addiction which was in part a coping mechanism for my Bipolar.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>
          Which as a result, gave me this surreal confidence to actually address
          my porn addiction.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          For whatever reason, when you get everything off your chest, it just
          completely changes everything.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          You no longer feel guilt for who you are and you no longer see
          yourself as a monster.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          You merely see your actions as a symptom of something greater, which
          allows you to not take them personally, and not react to them
          negatively.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          In addition, it also meant that I could ask for help and support when
          required. I could tell her that I was struggling with my porn
          addiction, and not feel judged or vindicated.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Understanding and recognising my disorder, which I&rsquo;d previously
          dismissed, helped me better understand my emotions and therefore,
          manage them a lot more easily.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>
          I finally felt free to just move on with my life.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          And it&rsquo;s impossible to understate what that feels like.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          The second thing which happened, which came about in large part due to
          my breakdown and coming out about my Bipolar, was equally if not more
          profound in terms of addressing my porn addiction.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>
          Essentially, I'd discovered this thing called meditation.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          The funny thing about meditation is that I&rsquo;d tried doing it
          through out various phases of my life to no avail.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Or perhaps all that effort had accumulated up until then, I&rsquo;m
          not entirely sure.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Regardless, up until then I&rsquo;d failed to see the value in the
          meditation.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          However following my break down, I&rsquo;d decided to take my mental
          health seriously, and I was determined to do everything in my power to
          get better.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          A friend at work had mentioned the benefits of meditation in his life,
          as well as a popular guided meditation course which he swore his life
          by.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          So I decided to do this course, which was basically a 10 minute
          commitment before bed each day, and my gosh.

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>
          I can happily say that within two weeks of meditating I'd learnt more
          about how to manage my porn addiction than in absolutely everything
          I've done in the past five years to try and curb my addiction.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          All because of a simple 10 minute practice before bed.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>Absolutely incredible.</Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          The primary reason for this is because meditating allowed me to
          effectively control and manage my emotions
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Primarily, the practice of meditation provided me with the ability to
          fully control my mind, something which I hadn&rsquo;t experienced
          before.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          It allowed me to relax my mind at will. To prevent incessant thinking
          and most importantly, not take my emotions and what I was feeling
          personally.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>
          If I had one piece of advice to anyone wanting to seriously overcome
          their porn addiction, it would be to start meditating today.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          It is possibly the most essential thing you can do to assist you in
          overcoming porn addiction.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Of course, what&rsquo;s also important is how you meditate, and
          that&rsquo;s precisely what I cover in this website.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          For example, a form of meditation I personally find incredibly useful
          is walking in public, and simply avoiding placing our attention on
          people walking past us.

          Now that I&rsquo;ve managed to successfully overcome porn addiction, I
          want to help you do the same.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Often the best way to learn something is to teach others how to do
          that same thing, and so that&rsquo;s what I want to do with NeverFap.

        <Text style={p}>
          To create a vibrant resource for other porn addicts to learn from, so

        <Text style={p}>
          The NeverFap method of addressing porn addiction comprises of five
          core principles.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Each principle maintains a purpose, along with a range of associated
          skills which you must develop in order to successfully address your
          porn addiction.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Without mastery of all five of these principles, we cannot hope to
          consistently manage the emotions, thoughts and behaviours which may be
          contributing towards our porn addiction.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          For more of a relaxed introduction, I highly recommend reading my
          article The Five Principles Of Neverfap As They Relate To My Life
          which explains how they apply to my own life.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Before we begin, we must ask ourselves a very important question:
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>
          What is a fundamental principle and what makes it fundamental?
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          A fundamental principle is a hard truth. It is something which remains
          true irrespective of whether you agree with it, how you feel about it,
          nor even how you understand or interpret it.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>It simply is.</Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          You may attempt to dispute these fundamental truths or argue against
          their validity, which is perfectly fine if that is your intention.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          However it certainly won&rsquo;t help you overcome porn addiction,
          which is the primary reason why you&rsquo;re here. You know, to
          receive help for a problem that you cannot do alone.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          My intention on the other hand is very clear. I am here to help you
          overcome porn addiction.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          So in order to do this, we must first set some ground rules and truly
          understand exactly what we&rsquo;re getting ourselves into.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr2} />

        <Text style={h2}>Ground rules</Text>

        <View style={hr2__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          The key thing to understand about fundamental principles is that they
          are not subject to open-ended thinking.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>For example:</Text>

        <View style={hrul} />

        <Text style={p}>
          <Text style={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>
            &ldquo;Well, my mind doesn&rsquo;t really work like that.&rdquo;
          </Text>
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          <Text style={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>
            &ldquo;While that may be true, I don&rsquo;t personally allow it to
            affect me in that way.&rdquo;
          </Text>
        </Text>

        <View style={hrul__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>This is not how fundamental principles operate.</Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Hard truths are not open to subjective questioning. Certainly,
          you&rsquo;re more than welcome to question them if you like, however
          it won&rsquo;t help you with your porn addiction.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          In fact, there&rsquo;s a very specific word that is used to describe
          when people refuse to accept the fundamental basis of reality.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>It's called denial.</Text>

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          Whether you realise it or not, the reason why you are a porn addict is
          because you are in denial about some aspect of your life.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Perhaps it is a misunderstanding of what you are capable of as a human
          being. Perhaps you have a low opinion of your self-worth. Maybe you
          never had the chance to develop any healthy coping mechanisms growing
          up.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Ultimately, the aim of these five fundamental principles is to help
          you expose the fact that there is something wrong with the way you
          currently think.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          As a former porn addict, I encourage you to embrace the idea that
          everything you know about yourself is wrong, and to not fight the
          unfamiliar.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          You cannot get better if you cannot first recognise that you have a
          problem.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr2} />

        <Text style={h2}>The Five Fundamental Principles of NeverFap</Text>

        <View style={hr2__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          On a superficial level, none of these principles seem to have anything
          to do with addressing porn addiction.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          For example, there is no fundamental principle along the lines of
          &ldquo;Never visit a porn website ever again&rdquo; or &ldquo;You
          should never willingly orgasm&rdquo;.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          A large part of the reason why this is the case is because porn
          addiction has very little to do with porn itself.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Rather, porn addiction is merely a symptom of a wider range of
          problems which NeverFap aims to address.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          So without further ado, here are the five fundmental principles of
          NeverFap:
        </Text>

        <Text style={h2}>01 - Choice over mind</Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          While all these principles are important in their own right, this is
          perhaps the one that people tend to struggle with most.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Or rather, it is a way of thinking and understanding which is
          completely foreign to most of us, and even those of us who do not have
          a porn addiction.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          What <Text style={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>Choice over mind</Text>{' '}
          iterates is the fact that you have complete control over your mind.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          This is irrespective of whether you currently feel in control of your
          mind, whether you agree it&rsquo;s possible to have full control over
          your mind, or whether you&rsquo;ve even experienced having full
          control over your mind.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>
          What's important to understand is that your mind is fundamentally
          capable of being controlled.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          I would personally say that this fundamental principle is both equal
          parts understanding and practice.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Certainly while practicing and exercising choice is important,
          understanding the extent to which we have choice will help us gain the
          confidence to truly feel comfortable dictating our thoughts, feelings,
          emotions and behaviour.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          By in large, the way this confidence is achieved is through controlled
          meditation and perspective training, which is covered extensively
          throughout the NeverFap Deluxe Practices section.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          For example, a situation where many porn addicts believe they do not
          have control is in public.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Many porn addicts (particularly male porn addicts) have a tendency to
          stare at women they find attractive in public. In particular, control
          over staring at hot women in public.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Well, I&rsquo;m here to tell you that with daily practice, we can
          learn to develop control over our mind, and completely filter the
          women we walk past in public altogether.
        </Text>

        <Text style={h2}>02 - Balance over reward</Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          This is one of those concepts that people think they understand, and
          yet refutely misunderstand simply because of how obliviously
          unbalanced they are to begin with.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          In fact, it&rsquo;s something most people outright ignore because they
          don&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s &ldquo;that big of a deal&rdquo;, not
          quite understanding the consequences that ignoring balance can have on
          their life.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>In other words, denial.</Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          What <Text style={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>Balance over reward</Text>{' '}
          maintains is this idea that we must prioritise balance over our
          immediate wants and goals.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>
          Often we become so affixated with something, either through obsession
          or neglect, we fail to consider the wider ramifications of our
          actions.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          So we cut corners in order to achieve or experience what we want, only
          to face the consequences of our actions later.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Not realising that the reason why we&rsquo;re struggling is because of
          the corners that we&rsquo;ve cut.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          For example, overworking ourselves is a prominent example of cutting
          corners in order to achieve something at the immediate harm to both
          our physical and mental health.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          We stay up late to finish what we&rsquo;re working on, ruining our
          sleep schedule and ability to regulate stress. We most cases, resort
          to caffeine and porn to keep us energised, resulting in addiction and
          dysfunction.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>
          And yet, we're so focused on the outcome that we don't quite realise
          what we're even doing wrong.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          Rather, we feel justified in our actions, inspite of the fact that we
          recognise that we may have a problem with addiction or our mental
          health.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Even though a) Cutting corners makes you less productive overall than
          if you were functioning normally and b) Having the added effect of
          ruining your mental health physical health in the process.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Instead, by learning to respect the principle of balance in your life,
          you can actually get more done overall without burning out, and
          without the constant baggage of emotional volatility and stress.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          I think part of the problem is that people fall into the trap of
          believing they&rsquo;re inherently unique when it comes to cutting
          corners.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>
          They think they can somehow "cheat" the system and come out ahead.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>Put simply, it&rsquo;s impossible.</Text>

        <Text style={p}>No one is immune to their own biology.</Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Even though people may not show it (in most cases, they simply know
          how to hide it very effectively), there is a hard limit to what
          everyone can do on a daily basis without it affecting their mental
          health.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          The point is that if we are to overcome our porn addiction, we must
          respect this limit and embrace balance in everything we do.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          This means taking breaks, even when we want to push forward. This
          means challenging ourselves, even if we don&rsquo;t feel like it.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          And by learning to value and respect these boundaries, you may gain a
          significant amount of control over your life.
        </Text>

        <Text style={h2}>03 - Awareness over all</Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Awareness is absolutely fundamental to everything we do.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          It is what allows us to identify and address the destructive patterns
          in our life, as well as serve as a stop-gap between our thoughts and
          our actions.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          What <Text style={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>Awareness over all</Text>{' '}
          maintains is that having awareness over our actions is critical to not
          only understanding the impact those actions may have over our own
          lives, but also how we can learn to gain control over them.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Without full awareness, we simply cannot hope to act with any amount
          of intention, nor understand the responsibility we have over them.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>
          Instead, we allow our habitual thoughts, emotions and beliefs to take
          over and continue their self-destructive patterns.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          I think the reason why most people struggle with this concept of
          awareness is because:
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          a) They&rsquo;re not currently aware, nor understand how to be aware
          because it&rsquo;s not something they&rsquo;ve ever practiced.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          b) Most people struggle to even understand what this concept of
          awareness actually is. (I was certainly one of them)
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>In reality, awareness is actually really simple.</Text>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>
          Awareness is your ability to sense the world around you.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>That&rsquo;s literally it.</Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          It&rsquo;s not about focusing your mind or trying really hard not to
          think, or even trying to figure out how to empty the thoughts in your
          mind.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Certainly, they may be useful skills and they may be a consequence of
          practicing awareness, however the actual action of awareness itself is
          simple.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>It is simply being present with your senses.</Text>

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>Pretty neat, huh?</Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          And when you&rsquo;re present with your senses and what you&rsquo;re
          feeling, it provides you with the ability to control and gauge your
          experience.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Witout reaction, and without taking what you&rsquo;re experiencing it
          personally.
        </Text>

        <Text style={h2}>04 - Struggle over none</Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Essentially, the basis of this principle is that the simplest path is
          often the most efficient.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          And as humans, we instinctly do what we find most simple, either for
          better or worse.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>
          Therefore, solutions which are simple by design are going to be more
          effective than solutions which are convoluted.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          It&rsquo;s the reason why I personally follow the paleo diet and only
          eat one meal a day.

          Because when you make a judgement, you essentially trap yourself into

        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Of course, the reason why it may not seem like a mental trap is
          because at first, making one judgement isn&rsquo;t going to kill you.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>But humans never just make one judgement.</Text>

        <Text style={p}>

          our perception of who we are and what we know.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          And when we make enough of these judgements, they can form into habits
          of belief which prevent us from exercising awareness.

        <Text style={h3}>
          After all, how can you be aware of what's going on in your mind, if

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          The more judgements you make, the more awareness you trade, and the

          world is.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          It becomes a trap because without realising it, through judgement you
          end up in a state of habitual unawareness, full of harmful behaviours
          that we have no idea how to control or influence.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Now imagine trying to address something like porn addiction under this

        <Text style={p}>It becomes almost impossible.</Text>

          Questioning why we may have become porn addicts within the first place

          journey.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Usually it entails reasoning along the lines that we must first figure
          out why we watch porn, and then target that thing which we believe is
          the root cause of our addiction.

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          In a lot of cases, this kind of questioning leads us to the conclusion
          that the reason why we&rsquo;re porn addicts is because porn itself is
          an addictive behaviour.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Which again, makes sense logically, especially if you spend a lot of
          time reading up on how porn and masturbation affects our dopamine
          levels.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Therefore, a lot of porn addicts then come to the conclusion that the
          only way to deal with their addiction is through discipline.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          In the hope that they can somehow get past their cravings long enough
          that they can then refrain from relapsing and end up remaining stable
          within the process.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          &hellip;and it&rsquo;s these kinds of approaches which form part of

        <Text style={p}>
          Which stems solely from first attempting to understand why we are the

          Put simply, the reason why this is the case is because it&rsquo;s a

          It’s like trying to figure out your life purpose by asking the

          You can have purpose for absolutely any reason imaginable, as you can

          On the other hand, if you actually want to figure out your life

          Of course, you obviously don&rsquo;t need to be so brash and

        <Text style={p}>Good luck with that.</Text>

        <Text style={p}>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>It’s called rumination.</Text>

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>And I personally consider it a form of self-harm.</Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Rumination is when you continually spur over your thoughts, without
          actually pursuing any hard actions as a result.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Understandably, it is an instinctive human response to ask why.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          But when we do it excessively, it serves no purpose and it becomes a
          literal bottleneck in terms of affecting our ability to process and

        </Text>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>

          If we look at something like learning to play basketball, it&rsquo;s
          clear there are a number of key skills we must learn.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          For example, there&rsquo;s dribbling, shooting, blocking and learning
          to run with the ball.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          It doesn’t matter if you don&rsquo;t understand what materials a
          basketball is made of, nor even who invented basketball.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Regardless of what your understanding of the sentiment behind

        <Text style={h3}>
          Another way of putting it is that we must focus on the how, rather
          than the why.

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          If it helps you can think of the understanding is the
          &lsquo;why&rsquo;, while the core skills are the &lsquo;how&rsquo;.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          When we focus on how to achieve something, we no longer become
          concerned with trying to define our circumstances using pre-existing
          knowledge.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Instead, we become actively focused on actions which will help us
          change our reality for the better.

          No longer do they become about building narratives or perceptions of

        <Text style={p}>
          Because at the end of the day, addiction is a process.

        <Text style={p}>
          And although attempting to understand why you may be engaged in this

          NeverFap Deluxe aims to be a comprehensive solution towards addressing
          your porn addiction.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          While there are many resources out there on the internet which
          accurately describe what porn addiction is and how it functions.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          I couldn&rsquo;t find a single resource that could accurately tell me{' '}
          <Text style={{ textDecorationLine: 'underline' }}>
            exactly what I needed to do
          </Text>{' '}
          in order stop being a porn addict.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Which is a bit like saying: &ldquo;Hey buddy, you have a severe
          problem, but I won&rsquo;t actually tell you how to address it&rdquo;.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          &ldquo;However what I&rsquo;ll do instead is make you increasingly
          aware of it, so that you feel compelled to do something about it, even

        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Which really is of no help to you, regardless of how useful their
          information is at describing what your problems are.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Ultimately, there were two kinds of resources that I frequently came
          across:
        </Text>

        <View style={hrul} />

        <Text style={p}>
          <Text style={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>
            Incomplete advice from existing porn addicts, usually in the form of
            forum posts. Which were desperately hopeful at best.

        <Text style={p}>
          <Text style={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>
            Scientific descriptions of porn addiction is and how it affects
            various aspects of our mind.

        </Text>

        <View style={hrul__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          Certainly, while it&rsquo;s great to understand what happens under the
          hood from a scientific point of view.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          In no way does that actually help you deal with the day-to-day of
          being a porn addict, and in no way does it help dealing with being a
          porn addict any easier.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>
          So lieu of all this, I decided to create NeverFap Deluxe.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          NeverFap has one very clear purpose that other methods lack:
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          <Text style={{ textDecorationLine: 'underline' }}>
            <b>To help you successfully overcome porn addiction.</b>
          </Text>
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>And thus easily overcome porn addiction.</Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          The reason why NeverFap works is because it is built around verifiable
          steps and practices, which actively change the way you feel and think
          on a daily basis.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Using these practices, I have personally overcome porn addiction to a
          point that I literally do not think about porn at all.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          In addition, the NeverFap method of overcoming porn addiction has been
          built around Five Fundamental Principles that relate to my own life
          personally.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Which serve to help you not only gain a better understand yourself,
          but also cut through the denial of being a porn addict.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr2} />

        <Text style={h2}>Porn is not the problem</Text>

        <View style={hr2__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          Aside from the fact that NeverFap is a complete solution that aims to
          take you from porn addict to regular human being.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          I also believe NeverFap takes a very unique approach towards
          addressing porn addiction.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          You see, I maintain a very strong belief that porn addiction has very
          little to do with porn itself.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Understandably, watching and masturbating to porn is an incredibly
          addictive behaviour.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          However this doesn&rsquo;t explain why some people aren&rsquo;t severe
          porn addicts in the same way that were are. Much in the same way that
          some people are not addicted to alcohol in the same that others may
          be.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          And this is precisely where I believe scientific descriptions of porn
          addiction break down in terms of their usefulness at helping us
          overcome porn addiction.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Sure. It&rsquo;s interesting to understand how porn addiction works,
          but it still doesn&rsquo;t quite explain why some people are
          absolutely obsessed with it.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          <Text style={{ textDecorationLine: 'underline' }}>
            Which is to say that I don&rsquo;t believe porn is the underlying
            issue as to why we are addicted to porn
          </Text>
          .
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Rather, I believe that porn addicts are addicted to porn because of
          some sort of fundamental misunderstanding that they have subscribed
          to, which they haven&rsquo;t yet figured out.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Not only is this a reflection of my own experiences with battling porn
          addiction, however is a reflection of the actual practices and
          solutions out there which work to help us address porn addiction.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>What are we misunderstanding?</Text>

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          When you think about it, no one ever wants to be addicted.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          No one wants to self-harm and pursue behaviours which cause them
          suffering and misery.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          The only reason they do, often inspite of trying everything in their
          power not to, is due to this internal misunderstanding.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          In some cases, this misunderstanding can be due to a limiting belief
          they have about their own ability to overcome porn addiction.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          In other cases, they may simply not have the mental capacity to
          influence their emotions in order to prevent cravings, usually due to
          lack of practice with meditation and perspective exercises.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          In most cases, it&rsquo;s a combination of a number of factors, which
          they simply haven&rsquo;t figured out yet.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>
          This is why I came up with the Five Fundamental Principles of
          NeverFap, to help guide people towards understanding exactly where
          they may be going wrong.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          Perhaps what I like most about NeverFap is how it&rsquo;s designed to
          always provide you with a path forward.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          When you&rsquo;re a porn addict, almost everything is confusing.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          You doubt yourself. You second-guess what you&rsquo;re experiencing.
          And even though you may know you&rsquo;re doing the right thing, your
          emotions may be fighting you and telling you to do otherwise.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          With NeverFap there&rsquo;s always an opportunity to try and figure
          out where you went wrong, and figure out exactly where you&rsquo;re at
          and how to address your weak points.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          After all, at the end of the day overcoming porn addiction is nothing
          more than a skill, and it&rsquo;s a skill you can gain through
          practice.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          The more you practice, the more you build up your confidence and your
          ability to control how you feel about yourself, and eventually
          you&rsquo;ll be able to fully control whatever outcomes you desire.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Because I&rsquo;ve done it using this very same method, and you can

        <Text style={p}>What exactly is the NeverFap Maintenance Tax?</Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Well, aside from the fact that it&rsquo;s a term I&rsquo;ve
          more-or-less made up on the spot, the NeverFap Maintenance Tax refers
          to the time and effort required in order to maintain our physical and
          mental health.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          It includes things like meditation, exercising, relaxing, studying,
          meditating, eating and brushing our teeth.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>Everything that helps us keep regular.</Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          The reason why I call it a tax is because many of us have the attitude
          that maintaining these things is simply unnecessary.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          In fact, most of us can tend to view these things as a burden (usually
          due to the amount of time associated with actually doing them),
          despite the positive benefits they provide.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          So what ends ups happening is that become selective about what we view
          as necessary or not.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Maybe we don’t exercise, because we’d rather be studying or playing
          video games. Maybe we work or study too hard, because we don’t see the
          value in meditating or relaxing.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>
          In doing this, we make significant compromises to our ability to
          function.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          And what’s really disturbing, is how utterly unaware we are of how
          much we compromise in terms of our ability to function, often without
          truly being aware of it.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>Certainly, I’ve been there.</Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          And only now in retrospect do I realise how I was making something
          like giving up porn addiction almost impossible due to my own negative
          attitudes towards self-care.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr2} />

        <Text style={h2}>
          In other words, if you’re struggling with your porn addiction it may
          be because you’re not paying your maintenance tax in full.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr2__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          In order to demonstrate this, I’m first going to talk about where I
          personally was making those compromises in my life.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          And then explain the effect it was having on my ability to cope.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          As well as what successfully paying the maintenance tax actually
          entails.

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>Facing the consequences of imbalance</Text>

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          Prior to this realisation, I was under the impression that I was
          relatively functional and healthy.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          I was exercising three times a week. I was eating healthily. I was in
          a fantastic relationship. I was incredibly passionate about studying
          and I was full of ambition, ready to take on the world.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          On the other hand, there were other aspects of my life that were
          severely imbalanced.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Aside from being severely addicted to porn, I was beginning to suffer
          from anxiety attacks from my excessive studying.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          I was studying so much that it used to induce these kinds of
          &lsquo;coding nightmares&rsquo; where I would be mentally coding in my
          sleep, but stuck in an indefinite loop where I would just write the
          same code again and again and again.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>It was truly awful.</Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          My problem was that I was pushing myself too hard and I didn’t provide
          myself with the opportunity to relax.
        </Text>

          All because I didn&rsquo;t view relaxation as a form of maintenance,

          Instead of thinking about our immediate wants, we need to begin

        <Text style={h4}>
          In fact, ten minutes of meditation each day is probably enough for

        <Text style={p}>No, seriously.</Text>

        <Text style={p}>It really is that simple.</Text>

          Of course, the reason why this doesn&rsquo;t happen is because most

          Not to mention, most porn addicts have a hard time sticking to a

        <Text style={p}>
          Without diving too deep into the intricate details of how to meditate,
          nor necessarily what meditation actually is, let&rsquo;s start off by
          talking about what meditation effectively achieves.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          In essence, meditation is the most powerful way for you to regain
          power over your emotions.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Not just your emotions, but your thoughts, feelings and everything
          else associated with the inherent functioning of your brain.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Here&rsquo;s the deal, being a porn addict has changed the way your
          brain works.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>It&rsquo;s no longer stable.</Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          It&rsquo;s no longer doing exactly what you want it to.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>
          What meditation allows you to do is develop the ability to maintain
          control over your mind.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>So you no longer feel compelled to watch porn.</Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Of course, porn may not even be the reason why you lack the ability to
          control your mind.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          It may be that you never developed those healthy coping mechanisms
          growing up, and that it was inevitable you were going to be become
          addicted to porn or engage in other self-harming behaviour as a
          result.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Certainly, this is the category that most people fit into.

        <View style={hr2__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          Overcoming porn addiction is actually a relatively straight-forward
          process.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          It largely comes down to developing control over your emotions, as
          well as developing an understanding of how your mind works.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          In terms of developing control over your emotions, it means practicing
          meditation on a daily basis so that you can remain calm and collected
          irrespective of what may be happening external to your mind.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          In terms of understanding your own emotions, it&rsquo;s about having
          the capacity to not take your own emotions personally, and to remain
          calm when you feel as if your emotions are out of your control.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr4} />

        <Text style={h4}>
          If you can manage those two things, you'll more-or-less be 90% of the
          way there to overcoming your porn addiction.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr4__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>Yet most people struggle.</Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Precisely because they don&rsquo;t do those things.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          They don&rsquo;t meditate on a frequent basis. They don&rsquo;t
          understand their emotions.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          They don&rsquo;t know how to maintain control over their minds, and
          yet they wonder why they struggle.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          This is precisely the reason why meditation is important, because it
          provides us with the ability to face these challenges without
          hesitation or fear.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>
          When you have control over your emotions, it makes situations where
          you don't necessarily feel in control manageable.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>Yes.</Text>

        <Text style={p}>Manageable.</Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Because successfully overcoming porn addiction is largely about
          learning to navigate through your emotions, and manage them so that
          you can be in control of your desired outcomes.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          And you can&rsquo;t manage your emotions if you don&rsquo;t have
          mastery over your mind, along with your ability to produce and
          regulate them.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          So what exactly are some of the skills and practices of meditation?
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>For starters, there&rsquo;s observation.</Text>

        <View style={hr2} />

        <Text style={h2}>
          Observation is perhaps the most fundamental skill you can learn in
          regards to developing your awareness.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr2__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          It is the skill we will focus on and develop most throughout the
          practices here on NeverFap Deluxe.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          In part, because it&rsquo;s really hard to take something personally
          or lose our frame of reference when we&rsquo;re merely observing
          reality.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          As opposed to being invested in it with our own personal beliefs,
          thoughts and judgements
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Aside from observation, there is also introspection (our ability to
          look into ourselves), perspective (changing the way we think about
          things), as well as a whole range of different skills.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          These skills are broken into Five Fundamental Principles which allow
          us to focus on particular outcomes related to overcoming porn
          addiction.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>

        <Text style={p}>
          Specifically, how it relates to the Five Fundamental Principles of
          NeverFap.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          The first principle that I almost always introduce to people is{' '}
          <Text style={{ textDecorationLine: 'underline' }}>
            Choice over mind
          </Text>
          , because it is the one principle that most porn addicts (usually)
          find the most profound.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>
          Choice over mind relates to this idea that we have full control over
          how we react in life.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          It&rsquo;s an important concept to understand, because once you fully
          embrace the power of choice in life, you can learn to overcome
          life&rsquo;s most difficult challenges.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Of course, assuming you put in the required practice.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          In this article I want to help you better understand where you may be
          misunderstanding this idea of choice.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Because if you truly understood the power you currently have to change
          as an individual, you most likely wouldn&rsquo;t be on this website.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          So let&rsquo;s consider this your formal re-education.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr2} />

        <Text style={h2}>What is choice?</Text>

        <View style={hr2__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          It begs to state that everything in life is a choice.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          There&rsquo;s choice in how we feel. Choice in what we want to think.
          Choice in how we live, and what we want to eat.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          In fact, there&rsquo;s choice in almost everything that happens in
          life.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          And yet, this doesn&rsquo;t mean that we necessarily get to choose all
          these things.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          We don&rsquo;t get to choose our race. We don&rsquo;t get to choose
          how others live their lives. Hell, we certainly don&rsquo;t get to
          choose what the weather will be that day.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>And that&rsquo;s okay.</Text>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>
          Because I'm here to tell you that none of this matters.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>Here&rsquo;s the thing.</Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          You do have one choice which is so powerful that it effectively
          overrides every other choice in your life.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          In part, because it is the only choice you truly have control over.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr2} />

        <Text style={h2}>You get to choose how you want to respond.</Text>

        <View style={hr2__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          And it&rsquo;s a choice which overrides every other choice imaginable.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Of course, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re already aware of this fact. I
          mean, obviously you have the ability to react to life&rsquo;s
          circumstances.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Yet perhaps you don&rsquo;t quite understand the significance of what
          this actually means.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Perhaps you&rsquo;re misinterpretating what having this choice allows
          you to do, so let&rsquo;s explore that idea.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          When you truly understand what{' '}
          <Text style={{ textDecorationLine: 'underline' }}>
            Choice over mind
          </Text>{' '}
          means, it completely changes the way you look at things.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          You no longer become victim, or rather you realise that you never were
          victim, over that which you cannot choose.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          So what does it being able to respond actually mean?
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>
          Put simply, your ability to respond is the most powerful choice you
          have, because it is the only choice you as an individual can actually
          make.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          At no point do you have absolute certainty over any outcome in life.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Instead, what you do have is absolute certainty over your actions, and
          this is quite profound for a few reasons.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          If your ability to respond is the only true choice that you have, then
          it signifies that you have full control over your life.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Because response happens through actions, and actions are the only
          means through which we can change as human beings.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr4} />

        <Text style={h4}>
          Which really is to say that you have full control over who you want to
          become.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr4__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          In addition, it also signifies that we are all equal in terms of our
          ability to take action.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Which is to say that we all have that exact same opportunity to
          become, because we all have the same ability to take action.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          From this point of view, everything we are today can be viewed as a
          sum of our actions.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          From a potential point of view, we really are no different.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          We both have the exact same potential to respond on a low level with
          our thoughts and emotions.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>
          The only difference between you and me is in the actions that we've
          taken over time.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          Which is to say that if you responded in the same way that I did, then
          you also would not be a porn addict.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr2} />

        <Text style={h2}>Success and your actions</Text>

        <View style={hr2__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          The important thing to understand about success is that it
          doesn&rsquo;t happen at a high level.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>It happens on an emotional and physical level.</Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Success is the difference between choosing to remain calm in a tense
          situation, as opposed to losing our cool.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Success isn&rsquo;t about being wealthy or driving a fast car.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Success is about having control over our feelings and emotions, so we
          feel indifferent about how much money we or anyone else has.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          In the context of porn addiction, success is acknowledging that our
          cravings for porn are merely habitual, and not to be taken personally.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Success is meditating daily so that we can learn the skills to
          properly address our porn addiction.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>Remember.</Text>

        <View style={hr4} />

        <Text style={h4}>
          The only difference between someone who has successfully overcome porn
          addiction and someone who continually fails, is that the person who
          overcame porn addiction took the right actions to get there.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr4__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          Porn addicts really are no different from each other.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Every porn addict goes through the same feelings and emotions of
          helplessness, guilt and depression.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          The only difference is in how they choose to respond to these feelings
          and emotions, so they don&rsquo;t let them dominate their life.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Now, I&rsquo;m not suggesting that you&rsquo;ll be able to face these
          feelings and emotions by merely being aware of them.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>
          However, what I am suggesting is that with the right guidance and
          practice, you can develop the ability to be able to.

          The Five Principles Of NeverFap As They Relate To My Life
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          To be quite honest, the five principles are quite arbitrary.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Which is to say that they&rsquo;re meaningless until you develop a
          personal understanding of how they apply to your own life.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          While my article The Five Fundamental Principles of NeverFap is a good
          introduction into what they are, today I want to talk about what they
          actually mean in my own everyday life.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Because theory is one thing, however you may derive additional benefit
          from understanding how this theory applies to everyday situations.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>Hopefully you can relate.</Text>

        <Text style={h2}>01 - Choice over mind</Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Choice over mind reminds me that I&rsquo;m always in control of
          myself.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          It reminds me that I have the ability to control how I feel, control
          what I do, as well as control my reaction to life itself.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Essentially, it&rsquo;s a principle which gives me confidence over my
          porn addiction.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          It gives me the confidence to understand that no matter what, I
          ultimately decide what my relationship with porn is.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          I understand that if I struggle with porn, it&rsquo;s not because
          I&rsquo;ve lost control (in part because it&rsquo;s not possible to
          lose control, as opposed to simply making a bad decision).
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          But rather, because I&rsquo;m understanding some aspect of myself,
          which is causing me to struggle in some way.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          In addition, having this understanding helps me not take my
          relationship with porn personally.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          So in summary, Choice over mind helps me maintain that vital
          &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always got this&rdquo; mentality.
        </Text>

        <Text style={h2}>02 - Balance over reward</Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Balance over reward is perhaps the one principle I struggle with most.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          As an entrepeneur of sorts, I&rsquo;m rather obsessed with getting
          stuff done. As a result, I tend to overwork myself and even worse,
          develop mania and obsession in order to maintain this productivity.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>In other words, I struggle with bipolar disorder.</Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          And let me tell you, it is almost impossible to overcome something
          like porn addiction, when your emotions are completely out of whack.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>Yet, there is a solution.</Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Essentially, by embracing balance as a fundamental principle,
          I&rsquo;ve been able to avoid getting to a point of complete mania and
          obsession, and therefore not experience those highs and lows which
          derail long-term goals such as refraining from porn.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>What does this entail?</Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Obviously, meditation helps significantly in terms of training my mind
          to be calm.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          However I would say the biggest thing that helps is simply realising
          when I need to stop working.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Previously, I would continue working and writing up until before I had
          to go to bed, which would result in sleepless nights and would even
          result in &lsquo;coding nightmares&rsquo;.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          What usually happens now on the other hand, is that I will simply stop
          doing any work around an hour and a half before bed, and that does a
          fine job of preventing mania and obsession from fully taking hold.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Sometimes I may still slip into mania if I&rsquo;ve been working
          particularly hard up until then, however the hour and a half is enough
          for me to calm down and switch my mind off.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          During that time I usually stretch, meditate and relax (usually by
          playing video games or watching YouTube videos).
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Initially it was really hard to stop myself from working.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          In fact, the very idea of forcing myself to play video games and not
          work was something that I found hilarious, but I also knew that if I
          didn&rsquo;t relax, I&rsquo;d ultimately be doing my mental health a
          disservice.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Now that I have this balance in my life however, I have much more
          control over my emotions and my attitude towards productivity has
          changed.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          I now realise that I am more productive by being balanced, and that I
          have more control over my life as a result.
        </Text>

        <Text style={h2}>03 - Awareness over all</Text>

        <Text style={p}>I love being aware of my feelings and emotions.</Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          It&rsquo;s like having a super power where you can instantly recognise
          what is happening within your head at any moment in time.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Awareness helps me with my porn addiction by allowing me to recognise
          behaviours and trends ahead of time, so I don&rsquo;t get stuck within
          them.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          What this means for me is recognising what I should be paying
          attention to in different situations.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          In that sense, Awareness is like that big brother which helps keep you
          together.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          That thing which helps ground you and which allows you to default to a
          healthy coping mechanism, instead of splurging on porn and excess.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          It is what allows me to always be in control, as well as remain calm
          and collected irregardless of what may be happening external to my
          brain.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          For example, If I&rsquo;m on public transport and there are a lot of
          pretty women around, I remind myself that I just need to effortlessly
          relax and focus on myself.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          If I&rsquo;m feeling stressed, I remind myself to time out and go for
          a walk.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Awareness is like a sedative that makes you more awake.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          It is what helps me cope effortlessly when life is difficult, and I
          simply couldn&rsquo;t see myself not being a porn addict without it.
        </Text>

        <Text style={h2}>04 - Struggle over none</Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Struggle over none is all about understanding that which we
          misunderstand.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          It&rsquo;s about understanding that we do have choice over what
          happens in life, and that there&rsquo;s no reason what-so-ever to take
          it personally when we feel out of control.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          In other words, it&rsquo;s about having empathy for yourself.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>We all have periods where we struggle.</Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          We may be struggling with how to deal with others. We may be
          struggling with a difficult problem we&rsquo;ve been tasked to solve
          at work. We may even be struggling figure out the best way to address
          our emotions.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          During these times, this principle is here to remind you:
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          &ldquo;That&rsquo;s totally fine. There&rsquo;s no reason to react. I
          fully accept what I&rsquo;m feeling as merely a by-product of
          misunderstanding, and there&rsquo;s nothing necessarily wrong with
          these negative feelings.&rdquo;
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          In contrast, my previous self would usually try to fight back.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          I would fail to recognise my struggle as a misunderstanding, and
          instead I would assume it was because I wasn&rsquo;t trying hard
          enough, or because my emotions were becoming unmanagable.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Which would obviously make everything worse, eventually leading to
          relapse in some form.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          When I struggle with my feelings and emotions now, I actually feel
          rather calm on some level.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          I embrace and recognise those emotions as something not to take
          personally and I relax into them.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          I don&rsquo;t take them personally, and I thank them for explaining to
          me that I&rsquo;m personally doing something incorrect which is
          causing me to feel this way.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          After all, it&rsquo;s really hard to take something personally and
          react to it when you accept and acknowledge something for what it is.
        </Text>

        <Text style={h2}>05 - Uncondition over judgement</Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          This is the principle most porn addicts generally struggle with at
          first.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Of course, being judgemental is not a problem specific to porn
          addiction itself, however it is certainly a strong contributor towards
          it.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          In a sense, this principle is sort of the opposite to Awareness over
          all.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Because what judgements essentially do is take power away from your
          ability to be aware.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          And it&rsquo;s impossible to observe and be aware of what is taking
          place in our minds, if your minds are constantly focusing on creating
          new thoughts and incessantly describing reality.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Certainly, I used to be a very judgemental person, often in ways that
          I didn&rsquo;t recognise as even being judgements.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          For example, I used to incessantly scan women in public, trying to
          find attractive ones to obsess over.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Overtime I&rsquo;ve learnt not to judge at all, simply because I
          realise is serves no purpose in regards to cultivating my mental
          health.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>Largely through meditation.</Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          There&rsquo;s one excuse that I often see porn addicts come up with in
          regards to their addiction.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>I don't have enough time.</Text>

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          Usually, it means time to spend towards addressing their porn
          addiction or mental health issues.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          After all, we&rsquo;re all incredibly busy people. We have things to
          do. Ambitions to fulfil. I mean, what does any of this have to do with
          porn addiction?
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          It&rsquo;s an attitude which quite ironically, prevents us from
          actually focusing on what&rsquo;s important in life.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>Which is why we&rsquo;re talking about it today.</Text>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>
          Because if you did have enough time to spend towards addressing your
          porn addiction, you simply wouldn't be a porn addict.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          So what exactly does it mean to not have enough time?
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>Well, that&rsquo;s entirely up to you.</Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Maybe it&rsquo;s because you feel compelled to always be in a state of
          constant &ldquo;productivity&rdquo;, and that time spent working on
          your mental health doesn&rsquo;t seem productive.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Or perhaps, it&rsquo;s merely the feeling of productivity you crave.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          For example, checking your phone every five minutes to see if
          someone&rsquo;s messaged you over Facebook.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          On the otherhand, you may just be so obsessed with your goals and
          ambitions, that everything else which sits outside of those goals is
          seen as being irrelevant.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Regardless of your interpretation, I&rsquo;m here to tell you that
          thinking that you do not have enough time for your mental health is a
          disorder.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>That is correct.</Text>

        <View style={hr2} />

        <Text style={h2}>
          If you believe that you do not have enough time for your mental health
          then you have a mental disorder.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr2__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          It&rsquo;s a mental disorder because it&rsquo;s a choice to willingly
          neglect one&rsquo;s mental health, due to habit and desire.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          And there are never any valid reasons why anyone should ever neglect
          their own mental health.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          It&rsquo;s the most important thing you have, and it&rsquo;s
          incredibly difficult not to suffer when you don&rsquo;t have your
          mental health in order.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          The moment you compromise on your mental health is when you introduce
          the potential to suffer.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Although perhaps you&rsquo;d rather suffer just to satisfy that
          feeling of productivity or get that extra bit further with your
          ambitions.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>
          Again, ask yourself how this mentality isn't a sign of having a
          disorder.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          Part of this disorder consists of valuing time over quality of life.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>So a question worth asking is:</Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          <Text style={{ textDecorationLine: 'underline' }}>
            <b>What is time without your mental health?</b>
          </Text>
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Without mental health, time becomes an uncontrollable struggle of
          judgement, self-criticism and depression.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Instead of having control over what we think and feel, we instead find
          ourselves taking everything personally and feeling helpless to
          absolutely everything in our life.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Without our mental health, days may seem like years in situations we
          largely find unbearable, which has the possibility to become any
          situation because that is no longer for us to decide.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Without our mental health, life becomes very difficult.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr4} />

        <Text style={h4}>
          Of course, there's a reason why poor mental health is often described
          as a self-repeating cycle.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr4__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          We choose to obsess over something which we believe will make us happy
          i.e. addiction, uncheked ambitions etc.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          We worship that activity with our effort and time, believing it will
          make us feel better about ourselves.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          We end up feeling empty once the obsession wears off, inspite of all
          the time we spent believing in these solutions.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Then we go and repeat the cycle again and again and again.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr2} />

        <Text style={h2}>And to be honest, it's a bit shit.</Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          It&rsquo;s hard to evaluate anything when your emotions are completely
          out of whack, and you genuinely believe that pursuing the same
          behaviours again and again will truly be &ldquo;different this

        <Text style={p}>
          One key thing to understand about mental health is that it&rsquo;s

        <Text style={p}>
          And the true beauty of mental health is that everything you&rsquo;ve

        <Text style={p}>
          Ultimately, it&rsquo;s about focusing on what you can do today, and
          this is the key to breaking this habit of never committing to your

        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Realising that mental health isn&rsquo;t achieved by what you

          If you don&rsquo;t truly believe or understand why your mental health

          Then you&rsquo;re going to continue to pursue activities which will
          conflict with your mental health.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Just remember that whatever other things you achieve in place of your
          mental health, can never replace mental health itself.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Which is to say that your achievements outside of mental health will
          never serve as a true solution to your problems.

        <Text style={p}>
          And when you do decide to work on your mental health, you may very
          well discover that everything you&rsquo;ve pursued up until then has
          been utterly pointless.

        <Text style={p}>
          So in the overall scheme of things, 10 minutes, or even an hour a day

        <Text style={p}>And what you practice is absolutely vital.</Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          In the case of overcoming porn addiction, this means practicing the
          core skills involved to help you regain control over your mind.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Anything else you practice outside of this, will not meaningfully
          impact your porn addiction in the same way that having control over
          your mind will.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          And the only way this is going to happen, is if you have an effective
          routine of practice in place.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          This means understanding why these practices are effective, finding
          the time to actually practice them and most importantly, doing these
          practices consistently.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>
          To start out, I recommend spending approximately 10 minutes per day
          practicing observation.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          Specifically, the Observe Your Senses practice which explains how to
          do this in the most simple way possible.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Observation truly is the most fundamental practice you can do in terms
          of developing your awarenes, and it is the practice we ask that you
          commit to every single day.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          In part because observation should form the fundamental basis of
          everything you do.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          From how you think to how you perceive the world around you.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr2} />

        <Text style={h2}>
          It's more-or-less the only exercise I personally do.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr2__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          In part because I&rsquo;ve already spent years doing all those other
          practices, and they&rsquo;re now less meaningful now that
          they&rsquo;re engrained into my head.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Whereas because observation is what I would consider &ldquo;a default
          state of mind&rdquo; is something which we need to continually develop
          on a daily basis.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Certainly, while those other practices are incredibly useful in
          developing new perspectives, they are merely supplementary.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          The aim is that once you feel you have a grasp of Observe Your Senses,
          you can start adding additional exercises to your routine.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>
          Personally speaking, I don't recommend doing more than one additional
          exercise at a time.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          Which is to say that an ideal routine will consist of doing{' '}
          <Text style={{ textDecorationLine: 'underline' }}>
            Observe Your Senses
          </Text>{' '}
          along with one other additional exercise.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Usually it makes sense to commit to these additional exercises for a
          week, before switching to something else.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Just because doing it only for a day, won&rsquo;t teach us very much
          in terms of how changing the way we think will truly affect us
          long-term.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          But of course, finding out what personally works for you is important
          as well.

        <Text style={h2}>My Personal NeverFap Routine</Text>

        <View style={hr2__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          I have a very basic routine which works really well for me.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Essentially, I spend around 40 minutes each day towards developing my
          awareness.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          With a few small key points throughout the day where I periodically
          zone out and just embrace calm.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>Here&rsquo;s how I would break it down:</Text>

        <View style={hrul} />

        <View style={ul}>
          <Text style={li}>
            <b>
              15 minutes of meditation as I walk to the train station in the

          </Text>
          <Text style={li}>

            </b>
          </Text>
          <Text style={li}>
            <b>
              10 minutes of meditation while sitting down in a room, around 15
              minutes before bed.
            </b>
          </Text>
        </View>

        <View style={hrul__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          This is the routine that I personally find works superbly well for me,
          in part because I don&rsquo;t need to necessarily go out of my way to
          make it happen.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          I&rsquo;ve simply adapted meditation to my everyday life, and
          that&rsquo;s what I recommend you do as well.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          In almost all cases, I am practicising observation of some kind,
          although usually encompassing different variations.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>I may focus on a very particular sense.</Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          In other cases, I may simply focus on emptying the thoughts from my
          mind.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>
          Regardless, I keep it super simple and that's why it works.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>Another thing to consider is self-care.</Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Ultimately, the reason why NeverFap works as a solution is because the
          core philosophy behind it is quite simple.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          And self-care is simply another aspect we can focus on, to make things
          even simpler.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Certainly, this isn&rsquo;t a focus of this website, so you can
          certainly do your own research into this.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          However below is a list of what I personally do to maintain self-care
          in my life.
        </Text>

        <View style={hrul} />

        <View style={ul}>
          <Text style={li}>I eat paleo.</Text>
          <Text style={li}>
            I do cardio and lift weights three times a week.
          </Text>
          <Text style={li}>I have a consistent sleep routine.</Text>
          <Text style={li}>
            I work on my hobbies and ambitions in my spare time.
          </Text>
          <Text style={li}>I play video games and watch TV to relax.</Text>
          <Text style={li}>I meditate approximately three times a day.</Text>
          <Text style={li}>I work a typical nine-to-five job.</Text>
          <Text style={li}>I brush my teeth in the morning and at night.</Text>
          <Text style={li}>I have a cold shower every night.</Text>
        </View>

        <View style={hrul__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          The extent to which you maintain self-care is entirely up to you.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          In any case, I hope this post has helped you better understand what
          you can expect from a consistent never
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          I encourage you to start small and simply commit to 10 minutes of
          meditation each day.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          That&rsquo;s precisely how I started and to be quite honest, spending
          10 minutes each day was enough for me to see significant changes in
          the way I thought over the space of a few weeks.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          So don&rsquo;t feel as if you need to commit all your time to doing
          this.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Remember, it&rsquo;s not how much you practice that counts, but what
          you practice that matters.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          In particular, if you feel as if you&rsquo;re struggling to find time

          The thing I love most about NeverFap is that it&rsquo;s designed to
          make addressing your porn addiction easy.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          On a very low level it&rsquo;s about learning to co-exist with your
          emotions, in order to both avoid experiencing porn cravings
          altogether, as well as remain neutral when they do arise.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          And when you&rsquo;re not taking anything personally and you&rsquo;re
          not allowing any external influences from changing the way you think

        <Text style={p}>
          I truly believe that successful porn recovery requires an effortless
          approach in order to be effective, which is why I have designed
          NeverFap to be as effortless as possible.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          If I had to use one word to describe what NeverFap encompasses.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>I would use the word:</Text>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>Calm.</Text>

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>Calm is the default NeverFap state of mind.</Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          It&rsquo;s not about being excited, determined or ready to dominate
          the world with your new-found energy.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Those things will not help you sustainably overcome porn addiction.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>Instead, it&rsquo;s about being calm.</Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          When you practice the NeverFap Deluxe exercises everyday and apply
          them to your life, it makes you feel calm and collected.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          In large part because when you practice these exercises which provide
          you with the required skills and abilities to control your mind, you
          no longer fear the unknown.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr4} />

        <Text style={h4}>
          Because you know that you have a strategy in place, and you know
          exactly what to expect from your ability to address your addiction.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr4__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          Another part of the reason why being calm and collected is important,
          is because it becomes really difficult to self-harm or react
          emotionally when you&rsquo;re feeling calm.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>In fact, it becomes almost impossible.</Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Which is exactly what we want, and is part of the reason why calmness
          is so wonderful within itself.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>
          Because remaining calm doesn't require any effort.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          In it&rsquo;s truest sense, calmness itself is a lack of effort.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Calmness is the result of letting go of all your thoughts and simply
          just being.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Ultimately, it&rsquo;s only possible not to be calm if you&rsquo;re
          actively doing something to disrupt it.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Whether it be obsessive thinking, feeling or judging - all these
          things serve to disrupt our default state of being calm.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Of course, you may struggle to remain calm because you&rsquo;ve built
          this habit of obsessively thinking and judging everything around you.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>That&rsquo;s okay too.</Text>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={p}>
          Porn addicts often struggle to dissociate themselves from their
          addiction.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          In part because porn addiction plays on a very primal, and natural
          human response.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>Otherwise known as attraction.</Text>

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          After all, what is the difference between being attracted to a person
          in front of you, as opposed to a person on your computer screen doing
          rather promiscuous things?
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          According to your brain, there really isn&rsquo;t much of a
          distinguishable difference at all.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          What this effectively does is have us question whether we&rsquo;re
          truly addicted at all.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          You know, because being attracted to other human beings is just one of
          those things that we seem to do by design, so what then seems to be
          the big deal?
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Which expresses itself into edging, claiming that porn is in fact
          &lsquo;art&rsquo; and therefore okay in small doses, along a host of
          hilarious excuses that we can manage to come up with.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr2} />

        <Text style={h2}>
          I am here to tell you that this is purely your addiction trying to
          convince you otherwise.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr2__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          From a mechanical perspective, porn addiction is really quite similar
          to porn recovery.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          The reason why you are addicted to porn because you did not develop
          the skills and abilities in order to prevent yourself from
          successfully refraining from watching porn.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          It&rsquo;s not because you genuinely think porn is fascinating, or
          because you think you can&rsquo;t help yourself because you&rsquo;re a
          guy, or because you&rsquo;ve been watching it since you were 12.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          It&rsquo;s because you never developed the ability.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          And what happens is that people don&rsquo;t realise it&rsquo;s nothing
          more than an ability, and so they come up with all these excuses
          instead to try and justify their behaviour.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>
          Instead, what we're going to do is focus on developing this ability.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          No different to porn addiction, the reason why you will be able to
          successfully overcome porn addiction, is because you have the skills
          and abilities to refrain from watching porn.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Not because you&rsquo;ve managed to trick your mind into believing
          that porn is wrong, not because you&rsquo;ve successfully managed to
          use fear to deter yourself from watching porn, nor because
          you&rsquo;re just a really disciplined person.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          It&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;ve managed to develop that ability.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          And once you realise this, no longer will you feel compelled to seek
          any sort of justification for your actions.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr2} />

        <Text style={h2}>You simply won't need to.</Text>

        <View style={hr2__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          Instead, you&rsquo;ll identify them for the excuses they are, and
          actually focus on actions which will meaningfully impact your porn
          addiction.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>Such as engaging in daily meditation.</Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          More importantly however, you&rsquo;ll come to understand something
          very important about human will and desire.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Precisely, that it is and always will be completely independent of
          almost everything and anything.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Which is to say that there is no inherent &ldquo;meaning&rdquo; or
          &ldquo;purpose&rdquo; in life.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>
          There is only your ability and your commitment towards developing it.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          In the case of porn addiction, it&rsquo;s watching porn everyday and
          subconsciously reinforcing that behaviour every single day with your
          actions.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          In the case of porn recovery, it&rsquo;s meditating every single day
          and reinforcing your ability to control your mind.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          No one commitment or ability is truly different from the other.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          It is merely a choice you make based on what you want from life.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr4} />

        <Text style={h4}>
          Sure, you can claim that you're a porn addict due to x, y and z.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr4__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          However this kind of thinking simply isn&rsquo;t reflective of
          reality, nor can it help you overcome your porn addiction.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Because porn addiction is a process, not a retrospective idea based in
          any number of infinite possibilities.

        <Text style={h1}>The Easiest Way To Identify A Judgement</Text>
        <Text style={p}>
          Some people have a hard time identifying the judgements they make on a
          daily basis.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          It could be because they judge out of habit and therefore are doing it
          subsciously without realising it, or perhaps because they&rsquo;re
          simply unable to recognise a judgement once they&rsquo;ve made one.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Certainly, I had no idea about the extent to which I was
          subsconsiously making judgements, and it took me years to personally
          identify them all and dissolve the negative habit for good.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Of course, I&rsquo;m writing this article today so you can have a much
          easier time identifying the judgements you make on a daily basis, so
          you can live your life relatively burden free.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Essentially, it all comes down to a super simple technique we can use
          to instantly identify the judgements we make throughout the day.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          And furthermore, it&rsquo;s a technique that doesn&rsquo;t require
          paying a therapist hundreds of dollars per hour for the privilege.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>
          The technique is to pay attention to your emotional reactions.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          Your emotion reactions are a key indicator of whether you&rsquo;ve
          made a judgement or not, and in order to understand how this works, we
          need to understand what emotional reactions are.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          For starters, emotional reactions don&rsquo;t simply appear out of
          thin air.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          They exist as a reaction to an event, usually in regards to a thought
          we have about something.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>Enter judgements.</Text>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>
          You see, judgements are much more than mere thoughts.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          If they were just like any other thought, then much like most other
          thoughts we have, they would disappear completely from our conscious
          never to bother us again.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          For example, while most of us are unable to remember any thoughts or
          opinions we had of the weather more than a few weeks ago, let alone
          the day before.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Most of us can probably remember a time when our parents made us do
          something that upset us greatly, even if these events may have taken
          place more than a decade ago.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          In essence, what makes judgements different is that unlike typical
          thoughts that come and go, judgements are thoughts that we have put
          significant faith into and belief into.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          And it&rsquo;s this reason why they can be so destructive.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          For example, a lot of us make the judgement that we&rsquo;re not good
          enough and that we should try harder as a result (also known as
          self-criticism).
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>
          And when we make these judgements, we dictate how we're going to react
          on an emotional level.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          We come up with these deterministic narratives like:
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          <b>
            &ldquo;If that person doesn&rsquo;t shut up, I&rsquo;m going to get
            so mad!&rdquo;
          </b>
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          <b>
            &ldquo;If I fail this test, I&rsquo;m going to feel so helpless and
            depressed.&rdquo;
          </b>
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          In a lot of cases, we won&rsquo;t even necessarily vocalise these
          agreements and instead, we&rsquo;ll imply them in our actions.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          For example, we might get really tense when we&rsquo;re mad or
          stressed.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          And what can happen over time is that we may not even generate the
          thought or physica response anymore, and simply skip straight to the
          emoiton.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          For example, feeling sad because we don&rsquo;t have a girlfriend, or
          getting upset because things aren&rsquo;t going our way.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Certainly, these hidden agreements form part of the reason why these
          judgements can be so hard to identify, because often they take place
          completely out of conscious sight.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>
          Yet from the perspective of our emotional reactions, they are never
          hidden.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          Because although these agreements and beliefs are often hidden, the
          direct effect of those judgements are fully felt via the emotional
          reactions which shut us down and hold us completely at ransom.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>Via the emotional horror that pursues.</Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          This is when we feel the effect of those judgements most, and so
          paying attention to what you&rsquo;re feeling can be a key indicator
          as to whether you&rsquo;re making a judgement or not.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Only until we can identify these judgements through our emotional
          reactions, can we finally move on and learn not to react, instead
          choosing to remain calm and level-headed.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Of course, you&rsquo;re probably wondering. I&rsquo;m making all these
          judgements, but what can I actually do about them?
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>How is identifying them going to help?</Text>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>
          Well, the great thing is that we don't need to go any further than
          simple acknowledgement.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          Because anything further you do at this point, is unnecessary
          rationalisation which is the exact opposite of what we are trying to
          achieve, which is to learn to let go and remain relaxed.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Effectively, what we want to do is learn to let go of these
          judgements, and learn to simply function regardless of them.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Where people often go wrong is that they feel trapped once
          they&rsquo;ve identified these judgements, as if they&rsquo;ve done
          some great evil, feeling the need to dissect them or rectify these
          behviours and habits.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          The funny thing is that this behaviour within itself is an emotional
          reaction, brought about by judgement. For example, you may have the
          judgement that you&rsquo;re not good enough, and therefore feel the
          need to do something about it.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>
          This in part signifies the extent to which a lot of the judgements are
          simply subconscious habit.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          As well as why it&rsquo;s important that we address these judgements
          and hidden agreements now, rather than let them continue to develop.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Of course, many of us have been making these judgements since
          childhood, so it won&rsquo;t happen overnight.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Just remember that no matter our emotional reaction or judgement, our
          go-to response is to acknowledge that we&rsquo;ve experienced an
          emotional reaction due to judgement, and to simply move on.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Once you acknowledge something, not only does it help take you out of
          the reaction, which helps you in terms of remaining calm and
          refraining from reacting further.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          However it helps build your self-awareness and ability to identify
          these judgements in future.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>Of course, like anything practice makes perfect.</Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          And by using healthy coping mechanisms such as meditation and
          awareness exercises, we can go a long way towards developing control
          over our judgements and emotions.

          addiction.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>The intention is really quite simple:</Text>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>
          To help you develop healthy coping mechanisms in order to help you
          deal with your porn addiction.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          Exercises which are designed to not only help expand your capacity for
          capacity for awareness, however to also teach you to remain calm and
          relaxed with your feelings and emotions.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Here&rsquo;s the thing: As a porn addict you have trained your mind to
          watch porn as a go-to response to a variety of difficult situations.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          It could as a response to excessive stress due to work or school. It
          could be due to depression as a result of unsupportive family or
          friends. It could simply be due to the fact that you&rsquo;ve never be
          taught otherwise.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          What these exercises set out to do is reprogram the way you think and
          respond in these situations.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>
          Essentially, what this means is developing a new set of understandings
          and behaviours so you don't need to watch porn anymore to cope with
          these difficult situations.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          And the way we get you to do this is by practicing these healthy
          coping mechanisms so that they can become second-nature to you.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          So that you can learn to relax and even accept those negative feelings
          and not take them personally.

        <Text style={h2}>Encouraging self-discovery</Text>

        <View style={hr2__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          An important thing to note is that what we&rsquo;re truly embarking on
          is a process of self-discovery.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Which is to say that there are no right or wrong answers with these
          exercises and that there is merely how you feel in the present moment.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          As a result, observation is an incredibly important aspect of what
          we&rsquo;re trying to achieve here, because observation is what allows
          us to engage our brain and think about these feelings and behaviours
          in a meaningful behaviour.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          While awareness is certainly one factor, consciously engaging with our
          behaviours is equally as important as well.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Otherwise, we aren&rsquo;t truly being aware in a way that is helping
          us replace our unhealthy coping mechanisms, with more suitable
          alternatives.

          At the end of the day, the ultimate aim of NeverFap Deluxe Practices
          is to help you better understand ourselves.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Currently, we may not even know how to observe our sense, let alone
          understand what awareness actually is.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Through these exercises we can learn to better appreciate these
          aspects of our lives, and furthermore, utilise them as a strategy to
          help us improve our mental processes.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          The aim is to overcome our porn addiction, and there&rsquo;s no better
          way I know how than through calmness and awareness.

        <Text style={p}>
          One thing that porn addicts are more-than familiar with is this
          concept of hope and despair.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          The hope that comes from the initial excitement of starting their porn
          recovery process.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          And the complete despair that comes from breaking down a week later,
          when their urge to watch porn becomes unbearable and they decide to
          relapse.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          A cycle which seems to repeat time and time again.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>
          What I want to do in this article is explain the dynamics of this
          cycle.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>As well as explain how you can put it to an end.</Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          If you think about the key thing which defines these types of cycles,
          it&rsquo;s really a combination of expectation and emotion.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Expectation being our understanding that, &ldquo;This is the correct
          thing to do moving forward, and of course this time will be
          different&rdquo;.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Emotion being that push which convinces us that what we&rsquo;re
          experiencing must be true.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>After all, positive emotions never lie, right?</Text>

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          And when you combine those two factors together, what you get is a
          cocktail of mania so strong, that nothing we do or say can convince us
          otherwise.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>We&rsquo;re excited. We&rsquo;re motivated.</Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          In part, because we&rsquo;re feeling so low that we couldn&rsquo;t
          possibly think of anything better than to actually do something to
          change.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          So although nothing has actually changed in that moment, we feel as if
          something&rsquo;s changed.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>We feel as if we're already there.</Text>

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          Even though it&rsquo;s just our emotions making us feel that way.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          And even though nothing has actually changed in terms of meaningful
          actions to actually develop self-control and healthy coping
          mechanisms.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Then what happens is that these emotions eventually fade as the hype
          dies away.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          We find ourselves vulnerable since those very emotions which
          we&rsquo;ve relied on are now telling us that we really want to watch
          porn.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr2} />

        <Text style={h2}>
          And then we relapse and start and whole charade again.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr2__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          Perhaps the most common example of this is when we use something like
          fear to try and motivate us.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          We fear the consequences of that feeling of failure if we were to
          relapse. We fear not achieving our life ambitions due to the effects
          of porn on our life.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Fear which inevitably becomes craving, which becomes fear, which
          becomes craving, and I&rsquo;m sure you get the drift.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>So what&rsquo;s the alternative?</Text>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>
          The alternative is to develop proper self-control over our mind.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          The kind of self-control that allows us to dictate what we think, how
          we feel, as well as detach ourselves from these aspects so we
          don&rsquo;t take them personally.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          The kind of self-control you may believe is impossible.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          After all, you may be under the impression that what you&rsquo;ve been
          doing this whole time has been &lsquo;self-control&rsquo;.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          When in actual fact, chasing our emotions in this fashion could not be
          further from actual self-control itself.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>
          Self-control is not reliant on how we feel in any way.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          So anytime we pursue any actions or behaviours based on emotion, we
          essentially train our minds to embrace this instability.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          And over time, we eventually create this habitual understanding that
          our emotions are truly representative of what we&rsquo;re capable of.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          As opposed to this idea that our mind is in control of our emotions.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Hopefully this article helps you better understand exactly what
          happens in our minds when we pursue this cycle of emotion.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          In terms of moving forward, I highly recommend checking out our range
          of comprehensive NeverFap Practices which are designed to help you
          regain control over your mind.

          The Easiest Way To Not Take Our Emotions Personally
        </Text>
        <Text style={p}>
          There are times when our emotions can feel unmanagable.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          For example, we may be feeling intensely anxious about a date we have
          planned for that night, or we may even be feeling trapped and under
          the pressure to perform well at school or in our jobs.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          All situations which pique our urge to masturbate or watch porn, to a
          point where we can&rsquo;t help but feel as if we have no choice but
          to give in.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Ultimately, when we lose control over our emotions, we lose control
          over our ability to act effectively and it&rsquo;s these situations
          where we can begin to spiral down the path of relapse and
          helplessness.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>
          All situations where we collapse because we decide to give into our
          emotions and take them personally.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          And this really signifies the importance of why we shouldn&rsquo;t
          take our emotions personally.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Not only in order to be effective with our emotions, however also
          because these situations are inevitably going to arise in the early
          stages of our recovery.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Therefore, shouldn&rsquo;t be used as an excuse or perceived barrier
          to our recovery, when it&rsquo;s something literally everyone goes
          through.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          For many of us, being unable to effectively manage our emotions forms
          part of the reason why we&rsquo;re still addicted to porn.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          In fact, learning to be able to effectively manage our emotions is
          usually the first hurdle most of us face when it comes to addressing
          our porn addiction.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          We have a craving, we hesitate, we attempt to postpone it (usually
          unsuccessfully), and then we eventually give in.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>
          It's where many of us are stuck mentally, and that's why I'm here to
          help.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          I want to start off by saying that learning not to take your emotions
          personally is actually a super simple process once you understand the
          dynamics of how we take things personally.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Certainly, the first thing to understand about taking something
          personally is that it&rsquo;s often a subconscious response.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Which is to say that it usually manifests itself as an instant
          emotional reaction, rather than as part of an informed decision
          we&rsquo;ve made prior to the emotion reaction.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Otherwise we simply wouldn&rsquo;t bother with the drama, and
          we&rsquo;d avoid wasting all our energy getting worked up.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Yet because we&rsquo;re largely not aware of our own behaviours which
          cause us to reach this point, we end up going down a dangerous path
          where we lose control over our emotions.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Often because we&rsquo;ve simply never been taught otherwise.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>
          So what typically happens when we feel uncomfortable with our
          emotions, is that we try to assume control over them.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>Mentally on some level we think:</Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          <Text style={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>
            &ldquo;If I can force guilt or negativity onto myself, then I might
            be able to push myself to react differently.&rdquo;
          </Text>
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>or</Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          <Text style={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>
            &ldquo;If I try really hard to distract myself, then I&rsquo;ll
            forget about these feelings and they won&rsquo;t be able to affect
            me.&rdquo;
          </Text>
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Essentially, we attempt to manipulate ourselves in the hope that it
          will help us achieve a positive end result.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          A common example of this (in the case of anxiety, for example) is to
          talk ourselves up as a form of motivation.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          <Text style={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>
            &ldquo;I can do it! There&rsquo;s no reason to feel sad at
            all!&rdquo;
          </Text>
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          We tell ourselves that we&rsquo;re smart, confident and in-control -
          even though deep-down inside, our feelings are telling us otherwise.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          And so rather than making us feel better, it ends up making us feel
          worse about ourselves.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          In other cases, this can even manifest from anger and frustration:
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          <Text style={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>
            &ldquo;F*ck you PMO! I will conquer you!&rdquo;
          </Text>
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          And the funny thing, is that none of these strategies work. In the
          end, it merely exhausts us as deep-down inside it&rsquo;s not what we
          actually believe about ourselves.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>So here&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re going to do.</Text>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>Instead, we're going to refrain entirely.</Text>

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          And refraining from our emotions is the simplest way we can learn not
          take our emotions personally.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s not the million dollar answer you were
          looking forward, however it is the correct approach in terms of
          learning to develop control over our minds.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>Ultimately, there are no cheap hacks.</Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          There are good practices and your commitment to them through practice
          and consistency.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          So to reiterate, the easiest way to deal with your emotions is to
          refrain from interacting with them.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Now, where a lot of confusion comes from is this idea of what
          &ldquo;refraining&rdquo; truly means.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          For example, some people misconstrue it for meaning
          &ldquo;distraction&rdquo;.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          So in the case of being anxious, going and watching a calming YouTube
          video to cope with your difficult emotions.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Now it&rsquo;s important that we really think about this.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>
          Because going and watching a calming YouTube video is actually a form
          of reaction.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          It&rsquo;s you reacting to your anxiety by indirectly finding an
          activity to preoccupy you from thinking about it.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          This directly contradicts this idea of refraining, which instead means
          to remain calm and relaxed in the face of these emotions.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Which often means sitting there and choosing to consciously relax and
          engage in meditation, rather than find something to do to change what
          you&rsquo;re currently feeling.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          In layman&rsquo;s terms, refraining from taking your emotions
          personally is a bit like saying, &ldquo;Thank you, but no thank
          you.&rdquo; to your emotions.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          It&rsquo;s a form of acknowledgement where you recognise that
          you&rsquo;re in control, without allow them to have power over you.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Because when you react, you actually give that train of thought power.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          When you react what you&rsquo;re mentally communicating is.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>
          "Yes, these feelings are valid and now I am going to address them and
          respond to them".
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          Which is the opposite what we&rsquo;re trying to achieve with
          refraining from reaction at all.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Now, while we&rsquo;ve covered a lot of theory in regards to
          refraining and why we shouldn&rsquo;t take things personally, actually
          practicing this is a different story.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Essentially, in order to refrain effectively we must develop our
          skills of conscious awareness.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          The reason why this is important is that it will allow us to identify
          situations where we take our emotions personally, and instead learn to
          change those behaviours.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          And the only way we can develop our conscious awareness is by
          practicing awareness on a daily basis.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          We provide a variety of awareness exercises via the NeverFap Deluxe
          Practices section.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Then, you&rsquo;l have a much easier time learning not to take your
          own emotions personally.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          As well as remain calm in the face of emotional uncertainty.

          I personally remember very little about what my life was like back
          then, although if I had to approximate I would say that I was in Grade
          2 and that I had a relatively simple life.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          I don&rsquo;t remember any particular details, the people in it, nor
          is it something which really evokes any sort of emotion, regret or
          anything.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          It just was a period of time within which I existed, no different to
          my existence now.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>
          Well, that memory kind of sums up how I also feel about my previous
          porn addiction.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          Which is to say that my porn addiction is a lot like a distant memory
          to me.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          While I remember the attachment and depression that resulted from it,
          I don&rsquo;t remember a whole lot of the specifics in terms of why I
          did it, nor even what it felt like.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Furthermore, I don&rsquo;t really have any feelings towards it, since
          I haven&rsquo;t experienced the guilt, shame and sadness that arose
          from my habit in quite a very long time.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Instead, you could say that it feels no different to being 7
          years&rsquo; old.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>
          From a process point of view, it's actually quite astounding to
          understand why it's all a distant memory to me.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          For starters, I&rsquo;m obviously not watching porn.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          But let&rsquo;s really dig into what this actually means, because
          being a porn addict is so much more than just &lsquo;watching
          porn&rsquo; and turning into a pile of inconspicuous jelly.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          From a time perspective, I&rsquo;m no longer spending hours everyday
          looking at porn.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Which not only means physically watching porn, but also dedicating
          time to watch porn which could otherwise be spent on more productive
          pursuits.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Another aspect which people don&rsquo;t consider is the mental
          overhead of planning and organising that time as well.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          In my case, it meant consciously thinking about how I could masturbate
          to porn without my partner knowing, which not only affected my
          behaviour around her, but my mood as well if I hadn&rsquo;t orgasmed
          in a while.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>
          At it's worst, it was completely controlling my behaviour to a point
          of absolute obsession.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          There were times where I used to even do it at work, because I&rsquo;d
          had a bad day or I was feeling particularly desperate.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          I remember when I was working in a very confined office, I went as far
          as to walk to the local library so I could use my laptop and get a
          better image, rather than with my phone which I could afford to sneak
          into the toilet.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          You know, much like when I was absolutely obsessed with video games as
          a 7 year old, to a point where I would cry if my mother didn&rsquo;t
          let me play.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Of course, it&rsquo;s funny to look back at these memories and
          certainly, as awkward as it is to admit some of these things, because
          I haven&rsquo;t relived these behaviours in such a long time, it no
          longer affects me personally.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>
          Certainly, the biggest thing that's changed is my mental state.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          The behaviours that arose from porn addiction aside, the thing which
          I&rsquo;ve noticed most is the improvement in my energy and mental
          state.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          You know that post-relapse dopamine brain-fog fun-land of hell?
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Well, that&rsquo;s truly a thing of the past and my mind is in a
          constant state of being level and clear, especially with my daily
          routine of meditation help balance things out.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          I&rsquo;m no longer irrationally depressed and my emotions are no
          longer tipping up and down, like a bunch of ADHD kids on a see-saw.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>But wow, what a difference.</Text>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>
          I distinctly remember that feeling of calm I felt when I first started
          meditating.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          It was mind-boggling. It was like I&rsquo;d finally felt peace and
          control for the first time in my porn recovery journey.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          It was at that point that I knew I would never be addicted to porn
          again, because I&rsquo;d finally discovered a way to effortlessly tame
          my mind.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          And that&rsquo;s another thing which a lot of people don&rsquo;t
          realise: When you overcome your porn addiction, life actually becomes
          easy and enjoyable.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Because your emotions aren&rsquo;t all over the place, it becomes
          really easy to commit to your goals, and an amazing side effect of
          this is that you actually become happy.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>
          Like, not obsessive happy or manic happy, but just genuinely happy.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          The kind of happiness that doesn&rsquo;t ask anything of you, and
          which makes you feel completely at peace with yourself.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          While it&rsquo;s been a long and arduous journey getting to this
          point, I can definitely say that once you experience all these
          wonderful things, you&rsquo;ll never want to go back.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Of course, the hard part is getting to a point where you finally do
          feel this kind of peace, which is why we emphasise the importance of
          practice and consistency.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          As long as you stick with the process, you will absolutely succeed
          with your goal of overcoming porn addiction.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          It&rsquo;s also part of the reason why I&rsquo;ve put so much effort
          into crafting this website so that the process can make intuitive
          sense to you.

        <Text style={h1}>What Is NeverFap?</Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          NeverFap is a comprehensive method of overcoming porn addiction.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          It is the easiest and most effective method I know, based on my own
          experiences with overcoming porn addiction over the past five years.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>
          I would describe NeverFap as a system which is designed to give you
          self-control.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          Self-control over your mind. Self-control over your actions.
          Self-control over your thoughts, feelings and emotions.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>Now, chances are that none of this is new to you.</Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Chances are that you have been attempting self-control in some form or
          another for a while now, however it just hasn&rsquo;t quite worked
          out.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Maybe your porn cravings still get the best of you. Maybe you feel as
          if you don&rsquo;t even have control over your mood and emotions.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Maybe you&rsquo;ve completely normalised all these feelings and you
          don&rsquo;t believe that self-control is even possible.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr2} />

        <Text style={h2}>
          Well, chances are that you've been doing it wrong this whole time.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr2__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          Certainly, I was doing it completely wrong for the first five years of
          my porn recovery and there&rsquo;s absolutely nothing wrong with that.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          We all learn differently. We all have different life experiences.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>That&rsquo;s just how humans are.</Text>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>
          The thing to understand about self-control is that it's completely
          counter-intuitive.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          It&rsquo;s counter-intuitive in the sense that since you don&rsquo;t
          have self-control, everything that you currently know has no relation
          to helping you understand self-control.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>Porn addicts don&rsquo;t know about self-control.</Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Porn addicts know about being addicted to porn, because that&rsquo;s
          what they are.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          It&rsquo;s what they live on a daily basis. It&rsquo;s how they
          understand and relate to the world around them.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>
          So there's a few steps we must take in order to address this.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          For starters, we need to learn self-control from someone who knows
          how.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Which is easier said than done, because this then requires a change in
          attitude which you may not be used to.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          For example, in order to learn something from someone this entails
          both trust and commitment.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Two things which porn addicts generally don&rsquo;t have.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Porn addicts are generally skeptics and can barely commit to anything,
          since they don&rsquo;t already have control over their emotions.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          In part because they over-rely on their emotions, which change in an
          instant from &ldquo;I can do this!&rdquo; to &ldquo;Man, I really need
          to watch porn&rdquo;.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>So what hope is there?</Text>

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          Well, it can help to understand that no one is expecting you to beat
          this thing within a day.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Overcoming porn addiction is the kind of thing which may take you
          years to not only understand and process.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          What the NeverFap method does is start you with small commitments, so
          that you can more easily work up to larger ones.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          A key thing to understand is that learning self-control, and really
          anything for that matter, isn&rsquo;t driven by goals and
          expectations.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Learning is driven by the small things you do each day to practice it.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr2} />

        <Text style={h2}>
          Instead, the problem is that you're spending so much time fighting
          these goals and expectations.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr2__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          That you don&rsquo;t feel motivated, nor even comfortable committing
          to these practices, due to fear, doubt and a whole trope of negative
          emotions.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          And you&rsquo;re fighting these goals and expectations, why?
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>Well, as I said earlier.</Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Self-control is counter-intuitive for those addicted to porn.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Often the reason why we&rsquo;ve set these goals and expectations in
          the first place, is because that is what we understand will help us
          move forward.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Chances are that this is what we learnt as kids, or perhaps it is all
          we have ever known.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Again, there&rsquo;s absolutely nothing wrong with that.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          We&rsquo;re not here to judge, nor condemn. We&rsquo;re here to learn
          and become better people.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          In order to address this, the NeverFap method takes a strong focus on
          practicing meditation.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>Put simply.</Text>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>
          Meditation is easiest and most effective way that I know how to
          develop self-control.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          The primary skill we will be learning in regards to meditation is
          observation.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          If I had to describe the most important skill you can learn to help
          you overcome your porn addiction, I would say that observation is that
          skill.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Observation truly encompasses the default state of mind that you
          should be in almost all of the time.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>And furthermore, developing observation is easy.</Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Whenever asking these kinds of questions, it can always help to come

          And this particular question primarily relates to{' '}

            Struggle over none
          </Text>{' '}
          and how orgasming affects our ability to overcome porn addiction.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Personally speaking I do not think it&rsquo;s okay to orgasm if you
          have a porn addiction and I&rsquo;ve even taught myself not to orgasm
          during sex, so it&rsquo;s a guiding principle I take quite seriously.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Essentially, the reason why I don&rsquo;t orgasm is quite simple.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr4} />

        <Text style={h4}>The act of orgasming messes with your emotions.</Text>

        <View style={hr4__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          At the end of the day, I don&rsquo;t particularly care about the
          philosophical, nor even the moral arguments behind watching porn, nor
          even abstaining from it.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Ultimately I&rsquo;m a processes kind of guy, which means I care
          solely about the easiest and most efficient way to achieve something.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          So with this in mind, orgasming simply makes it harder to overcome
          porn addiction, whether it&rsquo;s to porn or not.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          Whenever you orgasm you still experience that intense dopamine rush
          which more-or-less makes regulating your emotions impossible.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          And as I state on this website, 5% of your time should be spent
          practicing Healthy Coping Mechanisms, while the other 95% of your time
          should be spent remaining calm and relaxed.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3} />

        <Text style={h3}>
          Certainly, it's incredibly difficult to remain calm and relaxed after
          an orgasm.
        </Text>

        <View style={hr3__bottom} />

        <Text style={p}>
          Especially if you&rsquo;ve been abstaining for weeks on end, as well
          as avoiding any kind of stimulus.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          It will hit you like a train, and your emotions will suffer big time.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
          It&rsquo;s the same reason why you also shouldn&rsquo;t binge eat
          carbs or take copious amounts of drugs on a daily basis.
        </Text>

        <Text style={p}>
