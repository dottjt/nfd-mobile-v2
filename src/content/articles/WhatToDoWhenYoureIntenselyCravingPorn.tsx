        <Text style={content__date}>2019-04-24</Text>
        <Text style={p}>So, you find yourself in a desperate panic and all you can think about is nutting a big one out?</Text>

<Text style={p}>Well, the response should always be the same, regardless of whether you&rsquo;re intensely craving porn, sitting at home in a calm state, or even completing an intense workout.</Text>

<Text style={p}>As the guide states, calmness is a core tennant of the NeverFap Deluxe Method, which is to say that your job is to always remain calm and relaxed no matter what you&rsquo;re doing.</Text>

<Text style={p}>If you&rsquo;re always relaxed and in-touch with your emotions, then there is no possible way that you can even begin to experience cravings at all.</Text>

<Text style={p}>And the reason why you&rsquo;re experiencing those cravings to begin with is because you&rsquo;ve lost balance in some way i.e. you lost your cool.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>Put simply, there are no opportunities to experience cravings when you are relaxed.</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>A key thing to understand about cravings is that they don&rsquo;t just happen all of a sudden, inspite of the fact that it may often feel like this is the case.</Text>

<Text style={p}>In truth, the path towards developing those cravings were set many hours ago without you consciously realising it.</Text>

<Text style={p}>And that&rsquo;s why I place such a heavy emphasis on developing awareness, because it&rsquo;s one of the most effective methods we have in regards to preventing ourselves from losing balance, so that we can identify these behaviours ahead of time and prevent them from taking place.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Often it can be an incredibly small decision you made hours ago, which can have serious knock-on effects later down the track.</Text>

<Text style={p}>For example, maybe you decided it would be okay to stay up late to pursue your work or hobbies, only to find yourself in a situation where you&rsquo;re now tired and have no control over your emotions.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Sometimes it&rsquo;s just a priority thing. Maybe you thought it would be okay to spend just ten minutes more playing video games, only to find yourself stressed out trying to catch up with all your chores.</Text>

<Text style={p}>There are many different ways we can lose balance, much of it (in most cases) largely obvious to you.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Like, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re more than aware that staying up late affects your emotions, or that binge eating affects your energy levels.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Well, I&rsquo;m asking you to take it a step further.</Text>

<Text style={p}>I&rsquo;m asking you to consciously act on this knowledge and stop yourself from making these reckless decisions.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Because I&rsquo;m here to tell you that there is no other alternative.</Text>

<Text style={p}>In fact, when it comes down to it, this is all the NeverFap Deluxe Method really is. Replacing Unhealthy Coping Mechanisms with Healthy Coping Mechanisms so that you can achieve balance in life.</Text>

<Text style={p}>A key misunderstanding a lot of people have with awareness is that it somehow gives you &ldquo;super powers&rdquo;.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>Like, you just practice your 10 minutes of meditation each day, and that suddenly makes you immune from everything.</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>Absolutely incorrect.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Instead, awareness is a tool that is designed to help you make it easier for you to do the hard (but right) thing, of consciously changing your thoughts and behaviours.</Text>

<Text style={p}>There is no &ldquo;easy way&rdquo; or &ldquo;cheap hack&rdquo; to overcome porn addiction.</Text>

<Text style={p}>At the end of the day, it fundamentally comes down to replacing Unhealthy Coping Mechanisms (such as watching porn) with Healthy Coping Mechanisms (meditation).</Text>

<Text style={p}>With Healthy Coping Mechanisms you can have the most perfect two weeks of feeling as if you&rsquo;re completely invulnerable to the influence of porn.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Only to breakdown into a puddle of mud the moment your mind decides to do a complete 180 and taunt you with your cravings for it.</Text>

<Text style={p}>If you don&rsquo;t replace the habits, nothing will change.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>Like most things in life, there's good news and there's bad news.</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>The bad news is that once you&rsquo;ve experienced an episode, there&rsquo;s very little you can do, because at that point you&rsquo;ve already lost balance and you&rsquo;re truly on your own at that point.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Especially if you haven&rsquo;t yet developed the skills to calm down and not take your emotions personally.</Text>

<Text style={p}>The good news is that there are a million ways we can learn not to lose balance, which means we can prevent ourselves from having those episodes at all.</Text>

<Text style={p}>And this is arguably a much more effective strategy than trying to deal with our problems in a reactive way.</Text>

<Text style={p}>With proper practice and by meditating daily, we can utterly crush this thing and leave your addiction in the dust.</Text>
