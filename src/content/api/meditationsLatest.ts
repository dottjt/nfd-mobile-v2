Observe What You See","content":"<p>In this guided meditation we explore observation as a concept to help us to learn to develop control over our thoughts.</p>\n\n<!--\nNeverfap meditate\n\nWelcome to the NeverFap Deluxe Guided Meditation series.\n\nMy name is Julius Reade and today we’re going to keep it simple.\n\nIn part, because meditation is one of the most simple things you can do as a human being.\n\nSo for this exercise I want you to get relaxed, preferably sitting in a comfortable position. and I want you to leave your eyes open for this exercise.\n\nEssentially, what I want you to do, without moving your eyes, or searching, is to observe what is in front of you right now.\n\nThere’s nothing to question. Nothing to think about. All we’re doing is observing what is in front of us.\n\nWhat do you see?\n\nYou know, an interesting thing that happens when I ask that question.\n\nWhat usually happens is that people will start thinking about what’s in front of them.\n\nThey’ll start trying to identify that which they are looking at.\n\nWithout realising that observation doesn’t require thought.\n\nYour eyes are already seeing and observing.\n\nThey are already sensing your surroundings, regardless of what your mind thinks.\n\nWhich is to say that what we want to focus on is that sensing, rather than that thinking aspect we’re so used to.\n\nSo with that said, simply observe what’s in front of you.\n\nWithout thought.\n\nWithout expectation.\n\nAnd I’ll let you do this for a few minutes.\n\n\nIf you find your mind wandering off during this exercise, then just gently remind yourself to continue observing.\n\nOf course, you may not be used to observing.\n\nInstead, you may be used to thinking.\n\nThey’re quite different concepts.\n\nBut that’s okay, because the skill we’re developing is an important skill.\n\nWhich will allow you to quiet your mind.\n\nGain control over your thoughts.\n\nAnd simply exist with the present moment.\n\nCalm.\n\nRelaxed.\n\nEssentially, in observation.\n\nIf you find your mind wandering off again, that’s okay. Just gently remind yourself to continue observing.\n\nTo continue to truly notice what is in front of you.\n\nAnd that brings us to the end of this session. Thank you for listening. I wish you best of luck with your day. This has been. The neverfap Deluxe Guided meditation series.\n -->\n\n<!-- Welcome to the NeverFap Deluxe Meditation series.\n\nMy name is Julius Reade and today I will be guiding you through the wonderful world of awareness and meditation.\n\nIf you're new to meditation, as always, the first step is to relax. To get yourself into a comfortable position, preferrably sitting if you're new to this. It's not recommended that you lie down for these exercises.\n\nCertainly, your posture is important as well, because your posture helps you better focus and remain in a state of being calm, while also being alert. And, remaining alert is such an important part of meditation, since the goal of meditation itself is to help us develop our awareness.\n\nAnd it can be incredibly difficult to develop that awareness, if you're slouched, or tense or not present with your mind.\n\nAwareness of course is important, so that we can become more mindful of our own thoughts and behaviours. Which as a result, can afford you greater control over those aspects of your life. Which can help us deal with mental illness, as well as a variety of different things such as anxiety and depression.\n\nIn today's session we're going to keep the focus simple. Because ultimately, that's what effective awareness is about. It's about keeping your mind simple, relaxed and focused.\n\nEssentially for this exercise, what we're going to do is pay attention to our senses.\n\nBy senses, I mean a number of things. For example, what your eyes are currently seeing.\n\nWhat your ears are hearing. Perhaps, there's a bird outside, chirping away or maybe you can hear the sound of a car driving by. It could even be the temperature of the air around and how that feels on your skin.\n\nThese are all sensations that we can pay attention to and focus on. And there truly are, any number of different ways we can sense the world around us.\n\nCertainly, with this exercise we're not attempting to create anything or necessarily even feel anything in particular.\n\nWe're merely attempting to observe what we're feeling and what we're currently experiencing from our senses.\n\nPersonally, I find it helps to refer to all of these feelings as a cloud of sensation.\n\nBecause when you think about it, we only have one consciousness to perceive all these sensations with.\n\nAnd so by observing all these sensations or even one of these sensations, what we're effective observing is our own single conscious awareness.\n\nSo, with this in mind... what is currently taking place within your own conscious awareness?\n\nWhat are you currently feeling within the cloud of sensation that is your own conscious experience?\n\nIt could be physical calmness. It could be, the sound of relative silence which you're observing. Perhaps it's really hot, or really cold where you currently are. What is the sensation, for example, of the clothes on your body. Maybe it's something you don't even notice. That's absolutely fine as well.\n\nWhich is to say that there really is no right or wrong way to observe your own senses.\n\nThere's merely our own conscious awareness and what we're currently perceiving within it.\n\nSo I want you to really focus on that cloud of sensation. And I'll give you some space to really explore what it is you're currently sensing.\n\n\n\nIf you find yourself getting distracted and thinking about other things aside from what you're currently sensing.\n\nIt may help to just focus on a single sense. Like your hearing.\n\n\n\nIf you're getting distracted, remember to gently think about that cloud of sensation.\n\nWhat you're feeling from it.\n\n\nWell, that brings us to the end of today's session.

Stay calm and don't forget to relax.  -->\n","date":"2019-05-25","draft":false,"slug":"observe-what-you-see","categories":[""],"tags":["meditation","porn addiction","addiction","awareness","awareness exercises","perspective","nofap","neverfap","neverfap deluxe"],"permalink":"https://neverfapdeluxe.com/meditations/observe-what-you-see/","mp3Url":"https://s3.castbox.fm/1d/10/e3/9239a649bb85addc36d0754c3a.mp3","podcast_url":"https://castbox.fm/episode/id2113294-id157387489?utm_source=podcaster&utm_medium=dlink&utm_campaign=e_157387489&utm_content=EP1%20-%20Observe%20What%20You%20See-CastBox_FM","podcast_player":"<iframe src='https://castbox.fm/app/castbox/player/id2113294/id157387489?v=4.1.190524&autoplay=0' frameborder='0' width='100%' height='300'></iframe>","section":"meditations"}]
