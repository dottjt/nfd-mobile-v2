We&rsquo;re motivated.</p>\n\n<p>In part, because we&rsquo;re feeling so low that we couldn&rsquo;t possibly think of anything better than to actually do something to change.</p>\n\n<p>So although nothing has actually changed in that moment, we feel as if something&rsquo;s changed.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>We feel as if we're already there.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>Even though it&rsquo;s just our emotions making us feel that way.</p>\n\n<p>And even though nothing has actually changed in terms of meaningful actions to actually develop self-control and healthy coping mechanisms.</p>\n\n<p>Then what happens is that these emotions eventually fade as the hype dies away.</p>\n\n<p>We find ourselves vulnerable since those very emotions which we&rsquo;ve relied on are now telling us that we really want to watch porn.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr2\"/>\n\n<h2>And then we relapse and start and whole charade again.</h2>\n\n<hr class=\"hr2__bottom\"/>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps the most common example of this is when we use something like fear to try and motivate us.</p>\n\n<p>We fear the consequences of that feeling of failure if we were to relapse. We fear not achieving our life ambitions due to the effects of porn on our life.</p>\n\n<p>Fear which inevitably becomes craving, which becomes fear, which becomes craving, and I&rsquo;m sure you get the drift.</p>\n\n<p>So what&rsquo;s the alternative?</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>The alternative is to develop proper self-control over our mind.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>The kind of self-control that allows us to dictate what we think, how we feel, as well as detach ourselves from these aspects so we don&rsquo;t take them personally.</p>\n\n<p>The kind of self-control you may believe is impossible.</p>\n\n<p>After all, you may be under the impression that what you&rsquo;ve been doing this whole time has been &lsquo;self-control&rsquo;.</p>\n\n<p>When in actual fact, chasing our emotions in this fashion could not be further from actual self-control itself.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>Self-control is not reliant on how we feel in any way.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>So anytime we pursue any actions or behaviours based on emotion, we essentially train our minds to embrace this instability.</p>\n\n<p>And over time, we eventually create this habitual understanding that our emotions are truly representative of what we&rsquo;re capable of.</p>\n\n<p>As opposed to this idea that our mind is in control of our emotions.</p>\n\n<p>Hopefully this article helps you better understand exactly what happens in our minds when we pursue this cycle of emotion.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of moving forward, I highly recommend

refraining from reacting emotionally, we can learn not to take our emotions personally.","content":"<p>There are times when our emotions can feel unmanagable.</p>\n\n<p>For example, we may be feeling intensely anxious about a date we have planned for that night, or we may even be feeling trapped and under the pressure to perform well at school or in our jobs.</p>\n\n<p>All situations which pique our urge to masturbate or watch porn, to a point where we can&rsquo;t help but feel as if we have no choice but to give in.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, when we lose control over our emotions, we lose control over our ability to act effectively and it&rsquo;s these situations where we can begin to spiral down the path of relapse and helplessness.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>All situations where we collapse because we decide to give into our emotions and take them personally.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>And this really signifies the importance of why we shouldn&rsquo;t take our emotions personally.</p>\n\n<p>Not only in order to be effective with our emotions, however also because these situations are inevitably going to arise in the early stages of our recovery.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, shouldn&rsquo;t be used as an excuse or perceived barrier to our recovery, when it&rsquo;s something literally everyone goes through.</p>\n\n<p>For many of us, being unable to effectively manage our emotions forms part of the reason why we&rsquo;re still addicted to porn.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, learning to be able to effectively manage our emotions is usually the first hurdle most of us face when it comes to addressing our porn addiction.</p>\n\n<p>We have a craving, we hesitate, we attempt to postpone it (usually unsuccessfully), and then we eventually give in.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>It's where many of us are stuck mentally, and that's why I'm here to help.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>I want to start off by saying that learning not to take your emotions personally is actually a super simple process once you understand the dynamics of how we take things personally.</p>\n\n<p>Certainly, the first thing to understand about taking something personally is that it&rsquo;s often a subconscious response.</p>\n\n<p>Which is to say that it usually manifests itself as an instant emotional reaction, rather than as part of an informed decision we&rsquo;ve made prior to the emotion reaction.</p>\n\n<p>Otherwise we simply wouldn&rsquo;t bother with the drama, and we&rsquo;d avoid wasting all our energy getting worked up.</p>\n\n<p>Yet because we&rsquo;re largely not aware of our own behaviours which cause us to reach this point, we end up going down a dangerous path where we lose control over our emotions.</p>\n\n<p>Often because we&rsquo;ve simply never been taught otherwise.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>So what typically happens when we feel uncomfortable with our emotions, is that we try to assume control over them.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>Mentally on some level we think:</p>\n\n<p><strong>&ldquo;If I can force guilt or negativity onto myself, then I might be able to push myself to react differently.&rdquo;</strong></p>\n\n<p>or</p>\n\n<p><strong>&ldquo;If I try really hard to distract myself, then I&rsquo;ll forget about these feelings and they won&rsquo;t be able to affect me.&rdquo;</strong></p>\n\n<p>Essentially, we attempt to manipulate ourselves in the hope that it will help us achieve a positive end result.</p>\n\n<p>A common example of this (in the case of anxiety, for example) is to talk ourselves up as a form of motivation.</p>\n\n<p><strong>&ldquo;I can do it! There&rsquo;s no reason to feel sad at all!&rdquo;</strong></p>\n\n<p>We tell ourselves that we&rsquo;re smart, confident and in-control - even though deep-down inside, our feelings are telling us otherwise.</p>\n\n<p>And so rather than making us feel better, it ends up making us feel worse about ourselves.</p>\n\n<p>In other cases, this can even manifest from anger and frustration:</p>\n\n<p><strong>&ldquo;F*ck you PMO! I will conquer you!&rdquo;</strong></p>\n\n<p>And the funny thing, is that none of these strategies work. In the end, it merely exhausts us as deep-down inside it&rsquo;s not what we actually believe about ourselves.</p>\n\n<p>So here&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re going to do.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>Instead, we're going to refrain entirely.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>And refraining from our emotions is the simplest way we can learn not take our emotions personally.</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s not the million dollar answer you were looking forward, however it is the correct approach in terms of learning to develop control over our minds.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, there are no cheap hacks.</p>\n\n<p>There are good practices and your commitment to them through practice and consistency.</p>\n\n<p>So to reiterate, the easiest way to deal with your emotions is to refrain from interacting with them.</p>\n\n<p>Now, where a lot of confusion comes from is this idea of what &ldquo;refraining&rdquo; truly means.</p>\n\n<p>For example, some people misconstrue it for meaning &ldquo;distraction&rdquo;.</p>\n\n<p>So in the case of being anxious, going and watching a calming YouTube video to cope with your difficult emotions.</p>\n\n<p>Now it&rsquo;s important that we really think about this.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>Because going and watching a calming YouTube video is actually a form of reaction.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s you reacting to your anxiety by indirectly finding an activity to preoccupy you from thinking about it.</p>\n\n<p>This directly contradicts this idea of refraining, which instead means to remain calm and relaxed in the face of these emotions.</p>\n\n<p>Which often means sitting there and choosing to consciously relax and engage in meditation, rather than find something to do to change what you&rsquo;re currently feeling.</p>\n\n<p>In layman&rsquo;s terms, refraining from taking your emotions personally is a bit like saying, &ldquo;Thank you, but no thank you.&rdquo; to your emotions.</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s a form of acknowledgement where you recognise that you&rsquo;re in control, without allow them to have power over you.</p>\n\n<p>Because when you react, you actually give that train of thought power.</p>\n\n<p>When you react what you&rsquo;re mentally communicating is.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>\"Yes, these feelings are valid and now I am going to address them and respond to them\".</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>Which is the opposite what we&rsquo;re trying to achieve with refraining from reaction at all.</p>\n\n<p>Now, while we&rsquo;ve covered a lot of theory in regards to refraining and why we shouldn&rsquo;t take things personally, actually practicing this is a different story.</p>\n\n<p>Essentially, in order to refrain effectively we must develop our skills of conscious awareness.</p>\n\n<p>The reason why this is important is that it will allow us to identify situations where we take our emotions personally, and instead learn to change those behaviours.</p>\n\n<p>And the only way we can develop our conscious awareness is by practicing awareness on a daily basis.</p>\n\n<p>We provide a variety of awareness exercises via the NeverFap Deluxe Practices section.</p>\n\n<p>Then, you&rsquo;l have a much easier time learning not to take your own emotions personally.</p>\n\n<p>As well as remain calm in the face of emotional uncertainty.</p>\n","date":"2019-04-03","draft":false,"slug":"the-easiest-way-to-not-take-our-emotions-personally","categories":["struggle-over-none"],"tags":["context","judgement","porn addiction","addiction","awareness","awareness exercises","perspective","nofap","neverfap","neverfap deluxe"],"permalink":"https://neverfapdeluxe.com/articles/the-easiest-way-to-not-take-our-emotions-personally/","tldr1":"Essentially it comes down to refraining from reacting to our emotions.","tldr2":"When we react to our emotions we give power to them, as well as lose our individual power to react effective.","tldr3":"","tldr4":"","tldr5":"","section":"articles"},{"title":"What It Feels Like Not To Be Addicted To Porn","page_id":"74206abb-0de9-4f5c-a7d8-c0538befaf9f","description":"I explain what it feels like to no longer be addicted to porn.","content":"<p>One thing which people often ask me is:</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>What does it feel like not to be addicted to porn?</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>And it&rsquo;s an interesting question, because it&rsquo;s something I often think about and I think I&rsquo;ve finally found a way to convey this message accurately.</p>\n\n<p>If I had to provide an appropriate analogy which summarises what it feels like not to be addicted to porn, I would ask you to think back to when you were 7 years&rsquo; old.</p>\n\n<p>Now, for most people this is a rather distant memory.</p>\n\n<p>I personally remember very little about what my life was like back then, although if I had to approximate I would say that I was in Grade 2 and that I had a relatively simple life.</p>\n\n<p>I don&rsquo;t remember any particular details, the people in it, nor is it something which really evokes any sort of emotion, regret or anything.</p>\n\n<p>It just was a period of time within which I existed, no different to my existence now.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>Well, that memory kind of sums up how I also feel about my previous porn addiction.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>Which is to say that my porn addiction is a lot like a distant memory to me.</p>\n\n<p>While I remember the attachment and depression that resulted from it, I don&rsquo;t remember a whole lot of the specifics in terms of why I did it, nor even what it felt like.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, I don&rsquo;t really have any feelings towards it, since I haven&rsquo;t experienced the guilt, shame and sadness that arose from my habit in quite a very long time.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, you could say that it feels no different to being 7 years&rsquo; old.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>From a process point of view, it's actually quite astounding to understand why it's all a distant memory to me.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>For starters, I&rsquo;m obviously not watching porn.</p>\n\n<p>But let&rsquo;s really dig into what this actually means, because being a porn addict is so much more than just &lsquo;watching porn&rsquo; and turning into a pile of inconspicuous jelly.</p>\n\n<p>From a time perspective, I&rsquo;m no longer spending hours everyday looking at porn.</p>\n\n<p>Which not only means physically watching porn, but also dedicating time to watch porn which could otherwise be spent on more productive pursuits.</p>\n\n<p>Another aspect which people don&rsquo;t consider is the mental overhead of planning and organising that time as well.</p>\n\n<p>In my case, it meant consciously thinking about how I could masturbate to porn without my partner knowing, which not only affected my behaviour around her, but my mood as well if I hadn&rsquo;t orgasmed in a while.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>At it's worst, it was completely controlling my behaviour to a point of absolute obsession.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>There were times where I used to even do it at work, because I&rsquo;d had a bad day or I was feeling particularly desperate.</p>\n\n<p>I remember when I was working in a very confined office, I went as far as to walk to the local library so I could use my laptop and get a better image, rather than with my phone which I could afford to sneak into the toilet.</p>\n\n<p>You know, much like when I was absolutely obsessed with video games as a 7 year old, to a point where I would cry if my mother didn&rsquo;t let me play.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, it&rsquo;s funny to look back at these memories and certainly, as awkward as it is to admit some of these things, because I haven&rsquo;t relived these behaviours in such a long time, it no longer affects me personally.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>Certainly, the biggest thing that's changed is my mental state.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>The behaviours that arose from porn addiction aside, the thing which I&rsquo;ve noticed most is the improvement in my energy and mental state.</p>\n\n<p>You know that post-relapse dopamine brain-fog fun-land of hell?</p>\n\n<p>Well, that&rsquo;s truly a thing of the past and my mind is in a constant state of being level and clear, especially with my daily routine of meditation help balance things out.</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;m no longer irrationally depressed and my emotions are no longer tipping up and down, like a bunch of ADHD kids on a see-saw.</p>\n\n<p>But wow, what a difference.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>I distinctly remember that feeling of calm I felt when I first started meditating.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>It was mind-boggling. It was like I&rsquo;d finally felt peace and control for the first time in my porn recovery journey.</p>\n\n<p>It was at that point that I knew I would never be addicted to porn again, because I&rsquo;d finally discovered a way to effortlessly tame my mind.</p>\n\n<p>And that&rsquo;s another thing which a lot of people don&rsquo;t realise: When you overcome your porn addiction, life actually becomes easy and enjoyable.</p>\n\n<p>Because your emotions aren&rsquo;t all over the place, it becomes really easy to commit to your goals, and an amazing side effect of this is that you actually become happy.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>Like, not obsessive happy or manic happy, but just genuinely happy.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>The kind of happiness that doesn&rsquo;t ask anything of you, and which makes you feel completely at peace with yourself.</p>\n\n<p>While it&rsquo;s been a long and arduous journey getting to this point, I can definitely say that once you experience all these wonderful things, you&rsquo;ll never want to go back.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, the hard part is getting to a point where you finally do feel this kind of peace, which is why we emphasise the importance of practice and consistency.</p>\n\n<p>As long as you stick with the process, you will absolutely succeed with your goal of overcoming porn addiction.</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s also part of the reason why I&rsquo;ve put so much effort into crafting this website so that the process can make intuitive sense to you.</p>\n\n<p>I know you can do it.</p>\n\n<!-- For starters, it feels as if I never was addicted to porn.  -->\n","date":"2019-04-14","draft":false,"slug":"what-it-feels-like-not-to-be-addicted-to-porn","categories":["struggle-over-none"],"tags":["context","struggle","porn addiction","addiction","awareness","awareness exercises","perspective","nofap","neverfap","neverfap deluxe"],"permalink":"https://neverfapdeluxe.com/articles/what-it-feels-like-not-to-be-addicted-to-porn/","tldr1":"My porn addiction feels like a distant memory.","tldr2":"Your mind becomes clear and for the first time you actually begin to feel genuinely happy.","tldr3":"","tldr4":"","tldr5":"","section":"articles"},{"title":"What Is NeverFap?","page_id":"25f6759f-deac-436e-8408-ac51a1c1773f","description":"NeverFap is a comprehensive method of overcoming porn addiction.

Self-control over your actions. Self-control over your thoughts, feelings and emotions.</p>\n\n<p>Now, chances are that none of this is new to you.</p>\n\n<p>Chances are that you have been attempting self-control in some form or another for a while now, however it just hasn&rsquo;t quite worked out.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe your porn cravings still get the best of you. Maybe you feel as if you don&rsquo;t even have control over your mood and emotions.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe you&rsquo;ve completely normalised all these feelings and you don&rsquo;t believe that self-control is even possible.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr2\"/>\n\n<h2>Well, chances are that you've been doing it wrong this whole time.</h2>\n\n<hr class=\"hr2__bottom\"/>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Certainly, I was doing it completely wrong for the first five years of my porn recovery and there&rsquo;s absolutely nothing wrong with that.</p>\n\n<p>We all learn differently. We all have different life experiences.</p>\n\n<p>That&rsquo;s just how humans are.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>The thing to understand about self-control is that it's completely counter-intuitive.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s counter-intuitive in the sense that since you don&rsquo;t have self-control, everything that you currently know has no relation to helping you understand self-control.</p>\n\n<p>Porn addicts don&rsquo;t know about self-control.</p>\n\n<p>Porn addicts know about being addicted to porn, because that&rsquo;s what they are.</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s what they live on a daily basis. It&rsquo;s how they understand and relate to the world around them.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>So there's a few steps we must take in order to address this.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>For starters, we need to learn self-control from someone who knows how.</p>\n\n<p>Which is easier said than done, because this then requires a change in attitude which you may not be used to.</p>\n\n<p>For example, in order to learn something from someone this entails both trust and commitment.</p>\n\n<p>Two things which porn addicts generally don&rsquo;t have.</p>\n\n<p>Porn addicts are generally skeptics and can barely commit to anything, since they don&rsquo;t already have control over their emotions.</p>\n\n<p>In part because they over-rely on their emotions, which change in an instant from &ldquo;I can do this!&rdquo; to &ldquo;Man, I really need to watch porn&rdquo;.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>So what hope is there?</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>Well, it can help to understand that no one is expecting you to beat this thing within a day.</p>\n\n<p>Overcoming porn addiction is the kind of thing which may take you years to not only understand and process.</p>\n\n<p>What the NeverFap method does is start you with small commitments, so that you can more easily work up to larger ones.</p>\n\n<p>A key thing to understand is that learning self-control, and really anything for that matter, isn&rsquo;t driven by goals and expectations.</p>\n\n<p>Learning is driven by the small things you do each day to practice it.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr2\"/>\n\n<h2>Instead, the problem is that you're spending so much time fighting these goals and expectations.</h2>\n\n<hr class=\"hr2__bottom\"/>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>That you don&rsquo;t feel motivated, nor even comfortable committing to these practices, due to fear, doubt and a whole trope of negative emotions.</p>\n\n<p>And you&rsquo;re fighting these goals and expectations, why?</p>\n\n<p>Well, as I said earlier.</p>\n\n<p>Self-control is counter-intuitive for those addicted to porn.</p>\n\n<p>Often the reason why we&rsquo;ve set these goals and expectations in the first place, is because that is what we understand will help us move forward.</p>\n\n<p>Chances are that this is what we learnt as kids, or perhaps it is all we have ever known.</p>\n\n<p>Again, there&rsquo;s absolutely nothing wrong with that.</p>\n\n<p>We&rsquo;re not here to judge, nor condemn. We&rsquo;re here to learn and become better people.</p>\n\n<p>In order to address this, the NeverFap method takes a strong focus on practicing meditation.</p>\n\n<p>Put simply.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>Meditation is easiest and most effective way that I know how to develop self-control.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>The primary skill we will be learning in regards to meditation is observation.</p>\n\n<p>If I had to describe the most important skill you can learn to help you overcome your porn addiction, I would say that observation is that skill.</p>\n\n<p>Observation truly encompasses the default state of mind that you should be in almost all of the time.</p>\n\n<!--TODO: I talk more about it in this article Article on observation -->\n\n<p>And furthermore, developing observation is easy.</p>\n\n<p>For further information of the exercises and practices on this website, please head to our <a class=\"link\" href=\"/practices\">Practices</a> section.</p>\n\n<p>From there you can learn more about the various ways in which teach you self-control through meditation and various perspective exercises.</p>\n","date":"2019-05-01","draft":false,"slug":"what-is-neverfap","categories":["introduction"],"tags":["context","neverfap schedule","nofap schedule","porn addiction","addiction","awareness","nofap","neverfap","neverfap deluxe","neverfap basics"],"permalink":"https://neverfapdeluxe.com/articles/what-is-neverfap/","tldr1":"NeverFap is designed to teach you self-control.","tldr2":"Self-control is counter-intuitive, because you are not already in control of yourself.","tldr3":"Observation is the most important skill you can learn in regards to overcoming porn addiction.","tldr4":"","tldr5":"","section":"articles"},{"title":"Is It Okay To Orgasm If You Have A Porn Addiction?","page_id":"1448e0ac-19ee-4e1b-afa3-70315b7dfeab","description":"In this article I talk about whether it's okay to orgasm during your porn addiction recovery journey.","content":"<p>You may be wondering:</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>\"Is it okay to orgasm if you have a porn addiction?\"</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>Whenever asking these kinds of questions, it can always help to come back to The Five Principles Of NeverFap.</p>\n\n<p>And this particular question primarily relates to <u>Struggle over none</u> and how orgasming affects our ability to overcome porn addiction.</p>\n\n<p>Personally speaking I do not think it&rsquo;s okay to orgasm if you have a porn addiction and I&rsquo;ve even taught myself not to orgasm during sex, so it&rsquo;s a guiding principle I take quite seriously.</p>\n\n<p>Essentially, the reason why I don&rsquo;t orgasm is quite simple.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr4\"/>\n\n<h4>The act of orgasming messes with your emotions.</h4>\n\n<hr class=\"hr4__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>At the end of the day, I don&rsquo;t particularly care about the philosophical, nor even the moral arguments behind watching porn, nor even abstaining from it.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately I&rsquo;m a processes kind of guy, which means I care solely about the easiest and most efficient way to achieve something.</p>\n\n<p>So with this in mind, orgasming simply makes it harder to overcome porn addiction, whether it&rsquo;s to porn or not.</p>\n\n<p>Whenever you orgasm you still experience that intense dopamine rush which more-or-less makes regulating your emotions impossible.</p>\n\n<p>And as I state on this website, 5% of your time should be spent practicing Healthy Coping Mechanisms, while the other 95% of your time should be spent remaining calm and relaxed.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>Certainly, it's incredibly difficult to remain calm and relaxed after an orgasm.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>Especially if you&rsquo;ve been abstaining for weeks on end, as well as avoiding any kind of stimulus.</p>\n\n<p>It will hit you like a train, and your emotions will suffer big time.</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s the same reason why you also shouldn&rsquo;t binge eat carbs or take copious amounts of drugs on a daily basis.</p>\n\n<p>It makes it incredibly difficult to regulate your emotions in regards to the dopamine response that ensues.</p>\n\n<p>Orgasming, something which produces an excessive amount of dopamine - really is no different.</p>\n\n<p>You can sell it however you want as something that&rsquo;s inherently &ldquo;natural&rdquo; or &ldquo;porn-free&rdquo; and therefore okay.</p>\n\n<p>However so was excessive war and smoking at one point in human history, so I don&rsquo;t think these kinds of personal expectations based on the standards of society are valid.</p>\n\n<p>At the end of the day, you&rsquo;re going to have a much easier time overcoming your porn addiction by refraining from these behaviours in general.</p>\n\n<p>What <u>Struggle over none</u> describes is that everything we do should make overcoming our porn addiction easier, not harder.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, there&rsquo;s no reason at all why you should ever need to orgasm, even during sex.</p>\n\n<p>What NeverFap Deluxe is about instead, is developing control over your mind so that you have freedom over your life.</p>\n\n<p>So you don&rsquo;t feel as if you need to use porn, orgasm or masturbation as a form of release or self-expression.</p>\n\n<p>You can simply be thriving and happy, just the way you are.</p>\n","date":"2019-05-12","draft":false,"slug":"is-it-okay-to-orgasm-if-you-have-a-porn-addiction","categories":["struggle-over-none"],"tags":["context","judgement","porn addiction","addiction","awareness","awareness exercises","perspective","nofap","neverfap","neverfap deluxe"],"permalink":"https://neverfapdeluxe.com/articles/is-it-okay-to-orgasm-if-you-have-a-porn-addiction/","tldr1":"In general, you should not orgasm during your porn addiction recovery.","tldr2":"Orgasm in any form makes overcoming porn addiction significantly more difficult.","tldr3":"","tldr4":"","tldr5":"","section":"articles"}]
