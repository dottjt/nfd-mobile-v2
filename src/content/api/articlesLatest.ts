We feel obliged to do something about it, only to end up relapsing or doing something harmful like eat an entire bag of chips.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>However what people don't realise is that in 90% of cases, the correct thing to do is not react.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>In fact, that&rsquo;s part of the core tennant of what NeverFap Deluxe is all about, learning to remain calm and composed inspite of what you&rsquo;re feeling.</p>\n\n<p>To go into more detail, essentially 5% of our time should be spent practicing awareness via meditation, while the other 95% of our time should be spent remaining calm.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, the sooner you realise that you have no obligation to react, the sooner you&rsquo;ll be able to act more effectively out of principle.</p>\n\n<p>Another key thing to note about obligation is that it&rsquo;s merely a feeling.</p>\n\n<p>And by understanding that nothing is important, we can directly challenge this feeling in a way that bypasses it entirely.</p>\n\n<p>The sooner you learn to dismantle your ego and your thoughts, the quicker you&rsquo;ll be able to help yourself in a more constructive way.</p>\n\n<p>In particular, by remaining in control.</p>\n","date":"2019-06-02","draft":false,"slug":"the-trick-is-to-realise-that-nothing-is-important","categories":["balance-over-reward"],"tags":["context","judgement","porn addiction","addiction","awareness","awareness exercises","perspective","nofap","neverfap","neverfap deluxe"],"permalink":"https://neverfapdeluxe.com/content_articles/the-trick-is-to-realise-that-nothing-is-important/","tldr1":"Nothing is important, since everything relates to your ego.","tldr2":"Any opportunity to dissolve your ego is productive.","tldr3":"","tldr4":"","tldr5":"","section":"content_articles"},{"title":"The Importance Of Letting Go","page_id":"67819a08-abeb-40ee-921d-5959c66b1e4f","description":"This article describes the importance of letting go and how it relates to our ability to respond effectively.","content":"<p>Some people have a difficult time letting go.</p>\n\n<p>For example, some people will continue to latch onto negative feelings, regardless of whether these feelings are productive, let alone help us feel empowered about who who we are.</p>\n\n<p>Others have a hard time letting go of their own thoughts, as they find themselves paralyzed in indecision, stuck in a cycle of incessant rationality and self-judgement.</p>\n\n<p>Failure to let go may even extend to the toxic people in our lives, or even the self-limiting beliefs we have about ourselves, that we&rsquo;re simply &ldquo;not good enough&rdquo; or &ldquo;undeserving&rdquo; of love and attention.</p>\n\n<p>Regardless of what it is we&rsquo;re struggling with, the solution all points to the same thing.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>Learning to let go and learning to become free of these unproductive attributes.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>Of course, if it were as simple as walking away, none of us would have any problems and we&rsquo;d all be clear of our addiction and a-ok to continue with our lives.</p>\n\n<p>Well, today I&rsquo;m here to discuss not only the importance of letting go, but also how you can achieve this purpose by changing the way we think about attachment.</p>\n\n<p>Part of the reason why people struggle with letting go, is because there&rsquo;s a great fear and misunderstanding surrounding this idea of what letting go truly is.</p>\n\n<p>At first glance people will usually assume the worst.</p>\n\n<p>They&rsquo;ll view letting go as this process of inherently losing something.</p>\n\n<p>In particular, losing a part of themselves that they believe to be not only valuable, but irreplaceable.</p>\n\n<p>A part of themselves which they&rsquo;ve contributed towards for so long, that they can no longer distinguish between themselves from &lsquo;it&rsquo;.</p>\n\n<p>Under these circumstances, letting go then becomes this deep-seated fear of loss, potentially leaving this hollow shell of nothingness which we may end up regretting.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>Well, I'm here to tell you that this makes no sense what-so-ever.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>You see, you don&rsquo;t actually lose anything by letting go.</p>\n\n<p>There is no &lsquo;void&rsquo; once something leaves.</p>\n\n<p>If you think of the conscious human experience as a bunch of brain waves moving forward, those waves don&rsquo;t suddenly disappear the moment you let something go.</p>\n\n<p>Nor do you experience less waves, nor more.</p>\n\n<p>The only time this ever happens is when you die, and since you&rsquo;re still very much alive and conscious once you let go, nothing is even lost in a metaphysical sense.</p>\n\n<p>Those brain waves will still keep chugging along at the same rate as they did prior to when you didn&rsquo;t let go.</p>\n\n<p>So what actually happens then?</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>Well, what happens is that it allows you to experience different waves.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>Much like those brain waves which are being produced each second, it can help to think of the brain as a conveyor belt in an ice-cream factory.</p>\n\n<p>Regardless of which flavour of ice-cream you decide to produce, that conveyor belt is still going to be producing ice-cream none-the-less.</p>\n\n<p>If you think of all the awful things in your life as terrible flavours of ice-cream, then letting go of them isn&rsquo;t going to suddenly stop producing ice-cream.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, what happens is quite remarkable.</p>\n\n<p>What happens is that you begin producing neutral, vanilla ice-cream.</p>\n\n<p>Not worse ice-cream, just normal, plain ice-cream.</p>\n\n<p>And you know what? Plain ice-cream tastes a hell of a lot better than bad ice-cream.</p>\n\n<p>Which is to say that by letting go of those awful flavours, you essentially allow yourself the opportuinty to start from scratch and create new amazing ones.</p>\n\n<p>Put simply, you can&rsquo;t make great ice-cream from crap ice-cream.</p>\n\n<p>You need to start with neutral base and that&rsquo;s essentially what letting go provides.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>What people don't realise is that letting go is in fact an opportunity.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s an opportunity to experience something new. Something exciting. Something magical.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, half the challenge is that people remain so devoid of experiencing anything nice, that they therefore assume that these &lsquo;non-awful&rsquo; experiences simply don&rsquo;t exist.</p>\n\n<p>Well, they do - as long as you change your understanding of loss and fear in relation to letting go, as I&rsquo;ve mentioned in this article.</p>\n\n<p>Often what can help is to simply commit to the process without expectation. A lot of the time that&rsquo;s how I approach my gym workouts.</p>\n\n<p>Because sometimes feelings simply disagree. Sometimes you don&rsquo;t feel like working out, but that doesn&rsquo;t denote the importance of why you should be working out consistently.</p>\n\n<p>So how do you effectively let go?</p>\n\n<p>Well, like anything in life, it simply comes down to a matter of practice and consistency.</p>\n\n<p>There are quite a few exercises in our practices section of the NeverFap Deluxe website, which are designed to help dissolve your ego.</p>\n\n<p>And help you dissociate from your thoughts and feelings, so your ability to enact conscsious action can be exercised in full.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What Can Your Hand Do?</strong> and <strong>Stop Absolutely Everything You&rsquo;re Doing</strong> are good places to start for most people, although each exercise provides a different focus.</p>\n\n<p>Essentially, anything which can help you challenge that feeling of obligation you have not to let go, can certainly help on a cognitive and mental level.</p>\n\n<p>So get crackin&rsquo; buddy. Your mental health won&rsquo;t sort itself out without you.</p>\n","date":"2019-05-20","draft":false,"slug":"the-importance-of-letting-go","categories":["balance-over-reward"],"tags":["context","judgement","porn addiction","addiction","awareness","awareness exercises","perspective","nofap","neverfap","neverfap deluxe"],"permalink":"https://neverfapdeluxe.com/content_articles/the-importance-of-letting-go/","tldr1":"Learning to let go is one of the most important things we can do as human beings.","tldr2":"Essentially, you lose nothing by letting go.

Control over your actions. Control over your thoughts. Control over your feelings and emotions.</p>\n\n<p>Now, chances are that none of this is new to you.</p>\n\n<p>Chances are that you have been attempting self-control in some form or another for a while now, however it just hasn&rsquo;t quite worked out.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe your porn cravings still get the best of you. Maybe you feel as if you don&rsquo;t even have control over your mood and emotions.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe you&rsquo;ve completely normalised all these feelings and you don&rsquo;t believe that self-control is even possible.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr2\"/>\n\n<h2>Well, chances are that you've been doing it wrong this whole time.</h2>\n\n<hr class=\"hr2__bottom\"/>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Certainly, I was doing it completely wrong for the first five years of my porn recovery and there&rsquo;s absolutely nothing wrong with that.</p>\n\n<p>We all learn differently. We all have different life experiences.</p>\n\n<p>That&rsquo;s just how humans are.</p>\n\n<p>The thing to understand about self-control is that it&rsquo;s completely counter-intuitive.</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s counter-intuitive in the sense that since you don&rsquo;t have self-control, everything that you currently know has no relation to helping you understand self-control.</p>\n\n<p>Porn addicts don&rsquo;t know about self-control.</p>\n\n<p>Porn addicts know about being addicted to porn, because that&rsquo;s what they are.</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s what they live on a daily basis. It&rsquo;s how they understand and relate to the world around them.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>So there's a few steps we must take in order to address this.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>For starters, we need to learn self-control from someone who knows how.</p>\n\n<p>Which is easier said than done, because this then requires a change in attitude which you may not be used to.</p>\n\n<p>For example, in order to learn something from someone this entails both trust and commitment.</p>\n\n<p>Two things which porn addicts generally don&rsquo;t have.</p>\n\n<p>Porn addicts are generally skeptics and can barely commit to anything, since they don&rsquo;t already have control over their emotions.</p>\n\n<p>In part because they over-rely on their emotions, which change in an instant from &ldquo;I can do this!&rdquo; to &ldquo;Man, I really need to watch porn&rdquo;.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>So what hope is there?</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>Well, it can help to understand that no one is expecting you to beat this thing within a day.</p>\n\n<p>Overcoming porn addiction is the kind of thing which may take you years to understand.</p>\n\n<p>What the NeverFap method does is start you with small commitments, so that you can more easily work up to larger ones.</p>\n\n<p>A key thing to understand is that learning self-control, and really anything for that matter, isn&rsquo;t driven by goals and expectations.</p>\n\n<p>Learning is driven by the small things you do each day to practice it.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr2\"/>\n\n<h2>Instead, the problem is that you're spending so much time fighting these goals and expectations.</h2>\n\n<hr class=\"hr2__bottom\"/>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>That you don&rsquo;t feel motivated, nor even comfortable committing to these practices, due to fear, doubt and a whole trope of negative emotions.</p>\n\n<p>And you&rsquo;re fighting these goals and expectations, why?</p>\n\n<p>Well, as I said earlier.</p>\n\n<p>Self-control is counter-intuitive for those addicted to porn.</p>\n\n<p>Often the reason why we&rsquo;ve set these goals and expectations in the first place, is because that is what we understand will help us move forward.</p>\n\n<p>Chances are that this is what we learnt as kids, or perhaps it is all we have ever known.</p>\n\n<p>Again, there&rsquo;s absolutely nothing wrong with that.</p>\n\n<p>We&rsquo;re not here to judge, nor condemn. We&rsquo;re here to learn and become better people.</p>\n\n<p>In order to address this, the NeverFap method takes a strong focus on practicing meditation.</p>\n\n<p>Put simply.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>Meditation is the easiest and most effective way that I know how to develop self-control.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>The primary skill we will be learning in regards to meditation is observation.</p>\n\n<p>If I had to describe the most important skill you can learn to help you overcome your porn addiction, I would say that observation is that skill.</p>\n\n<p>Observation truly encompasses the default state of mind that you should be in almost all of the time.</p>\n\n<!--TODO: I talk more about it in this article Article on observation -->\n\n<p>And furthermore, developing observation is easy.</p>\n\n<p>For further information of the exercises and practices on this website, please head to our <a class=\"link\" href=\"/practices\">Practices</a> section.</p>\n\n<p>From there you can learn more about the various ways in which teach you self-control through meditation and various perspective exercises.</p>\n","date":"2019-05-01","draft":false,"slug":"what-is-neverfap","categories":["introduction"],"tags":["context","neverfap schedule","nofap schedule","porn addiction","addiction","awareness","nofap","neverfap","neverfap deluxe","neverfap basics"],"permalink":"https://neverfapdeluxe.com/content_articles/what-is-neverfap/","tldr1":"NeverFap Deluxe is designed to teach you self-control.","tldr2":"Self-control is counter-intuitive, because you are not already in control of yourself.","tldr3":"Observation is the most important skill you can learn in regards to overcoming porn addiction.","tldr4":"","tldr5":"","section":"content_articles"},{"title":"What To Do When You're Intensely Craving Porn","page_id":"d8e946b7-74cb-4598-aceb-ac052072e493","description":"The response when you're intensely craving porn is to relax and remain calm, no different to whether you're craving porn or not.","content":"<p>So, you find yourself in a desperate panic and all you can think about is nutting a big one out?</p>\n\n<p>Well, the response should always be the same, regardless of whether you&rsquo;re intensely craving porn, sitting at home in a calm state, or even completing an intense workout.</p>\n\n<p>As the guide states, calmness is a core tennant of the NeverFap Deluxe Method, which is to say that your job is to always remain calm and relaxed no matter what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>\n\n<p>If you&rsquo;re always relaxed and in-touch with your emotions, then there is no possible way that you can even begin to experience cravings at all.</p>\n\n<p>And the reason why you&rsquo;re experiencing those cravings to begin with is because you&rsquo;ve lost balance in some way i.e. you lost your cool.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>Put simply, there are no opportunities to experience cravings when you are relaxed.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>A key thing to understand about cravings is that they don&rsquo;t just happen all of a sudden, inspite of the fact that it may often feel like this is the case.</p>\n\n<p>In truth, the path towards developing those cravings were set many hours ago without you consciously realising it.</p>\n\n<p>And that&rsquo;s why I place such a heavy emphasis on developing awareness, because it&rsquo;s one of the most effective methods we have in regards to preventing ourselves from losing balance, so that we can identify these behaviours ahead of time and prevent them from taking place.</p>\n\n<p>Often it can be an incredibly small decision you made hours ago, which can have serious knock-on effects later down the track.</p>\n\n<p>For example, maybe you decided it would be okay to stay up late to pursue your work or hobbies, only to find yourself in a situation where you&rsquo;re now tired and have no control over your emotions.</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s just a priority thing. Maybe you thought it would be okay to spend just ten minutes more playing video games, only to find yourself stressed out trying to catch up with all your chores.</p>\n\n<p>There are many different ways we can lose balance, much of it (in most cases) largely obvious to you.</p>\n\n<p>Like, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re more than aware that staying up late affects your emotions, or that binge eating affects your energy levels.</p>\n\n<p>Well, I&rsquo;m asking you to take it a step further.</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;m asking you to consciously act on this knowledge and stop yourself from making these reckless decisions.</p>\n\n<p>Because I&rsquo;m here to tell you that there is no other alternative.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, when it comes down to it, this is all the NeverFap Deluxe Method really is. Replacing Unhealthy Coping Mechanisms with Healthy Coping Mechanisms so that you can achieve balance in life.</p>\n\n<p>A key misunderstanding a lot of people have with awareness is that it somehow gives you &ldquo;super powers&rdquo;.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>Like, you just practice your 10 minutes of meditation each day, and that suddenly makes you immune from everything.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>Absolutely incorrect.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, awareness is a tool that is designed to help you make it easier for you to do the hard (but right) thing, of consciously changing your thoughts and behaviours.</p>\n\n<p>There is no &ldquo;easy way&rdquo; or &ldquo;cheap hack&rdquo; to overcome porn addiction.</p>\n\n<p>At the end of the day, it fundamentally comes down to replacing Unhealthy Coping Mechanisms (such as watching porn) with Healthy Coping Mechanisms (meditation).</p>\n\n<p>With Healthy Coping Mechanisms you can have the most perfect two weeks of feeling as if you&rsquo;re completely invulnerable to the influence of porn.</p>\n\n<p>Only to breakdown into a puddle of mud the moment your mind decides to do a complete 180 and taunt you with your cravings for it.</p>\n\n<p>If you don&rsquo;t replace the habits, nothing will change.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>Like most things in life, there's good news and there's bad news.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>The bad news is that once you&rsquo;ve experienced an episode, there&rsquo;s very little you can do, because at that point you&rsquo;ve already lost balance and you&rsquo;re truly on your own at that point.</p>\n\n<p>Especially if you haven&rsquo;t yet developed the skills to calm down and not take your emotions personally.</p>\n\n<p>The good news is that there are a million ways we can learn not to lose balance, which means we can prevent ourselves from having those episodes at all.</p>\n\n<p>And this is arguably a much more effective strategy than trying to deal with our problems in a reactive way.</p>\n\n<p>With proper practice and by meditating daily, we can utterly crush this thing and leave your addiction in the dust.</p>\n\n<p>Please check out the Practices section to learn more.</p>\n","date":"2019-04-24","draft":false,"slug":"what-to-do-when-you-are-intensively-craving-porn","categories":["struggle-over-none"],"tags":["context","judgement","porn addiction","addiction","awareness","awareness exercises","perspective","nofap","neverfap","neverfap deluxe"],"permalink":"https://neverfapdeluxe.com/content_articles/what-to-do-when-you-are-intensively-craving-porn/","tldr1":"Your response in every situation is to remain calm.","tldr2":"Only through awareness can we identify behaviours which cause us to lose balance.","tldr3":"","tldr4":"","tldr5":"","section":"content_articles"}]
