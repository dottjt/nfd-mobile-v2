For example, you might want to experiment with hourly intervals instead.</p>\n\n<p>(although I tend to find the longer the duration, the harder it is for people starting out)</p>\n\n<p>In addition, I want to add that this is can be a real tough one!</p>\n\n<p>Although it sounds easy in practice, humans tend to forget. It&rsquo;s a bit like when we feel distracted during meditation, and we find ourselves thinking about something irrelevant.</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes we can have a hard time maintaining our conscious awareness, however this is precisely why we&rsquo;re practicing this exercise.</p>\n\n<p>So we can focus on what&rsquo;s important.</p>\n\n<p>Our mental health.</p>\n\n<p>ka-ching</p>\n\n<!-- \n<hr class=\"hr2\"/>\n\n<h2>Additional Resources</h2>\n\n<hr class=\"hr2__bottom\"/>\n\n\n\n\n\n  -->\n\n<!-- maybe link to other  -->\n","date":"2019-04-20","draft":false,"slug":"every-30-minutes","categories":["uncondition-over-judgement"],"tags":["practice","meditation","porn addiction","addiction","awareness","awareness exercises","perspective","nofap","neverfap","neverfap deluxe"],"permalink":"https://neverfapdeluxe.com/practices/every-30-minutes/","overview":"","category":"Uncondition over judgement","what":"Develop your capacity for conscious awareness.","how":"By taking note of points throughout the day at certain intervals.","when":"Every 30 minutes from the moment you wake up.","duration":"A few seconds each moment.","section":"practices"},{"title":"Focus Your Attention On The Right Side Of Your Vision","page_id":"75452f30-3991-4f6e-b0bd-dc77771d87f0","description":"Focus your attention on the right side of your vision in order to train your capacity for awareness.","content":"<p>This is another classic awareness exercise which is short and straight-to-the-point.</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s designed to help you think about something which you ordinarily wouldn&rsquo;t think about, which can help you expand your conscious awareness.</p>\n\n<p>I suppose what I like about this particular variation of awareness exercise, is that it really points out how subtle our focus and attention can be.</p>\n\n<p>While there are much more demanding awareness exercises such as <a class=\"link\" href=\"/practices/observe-your-senses\">Observe Your Senses</a> this exercise highlights that focus and attention can still be achieved in the day-to-day of our busy lives.</p>\n\n<p>And that&rsquo;s really the beauty of focus and attention.</p>\n\n<p>As outlined in <a class=\"link\" href=\"/practices/blind-attention\">Blind Attention</a> it can be absolutely anything you want it to be, it simply comes down to your ability to conceptually think about it in everyday situations, and this exercise is designed to help you do that.</p>\n\n<p>So without further ado, let&rsquo;s get to the meat of it.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr2\"/>\n\n<h2>Instructions</h2>\n\n<hr class=\"hr2__bottom\"/>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>For this exercise what you want to do is focus your attention on the right side of your vision.</p>\n\n<p>I find this exercise works most effectively while you&rsquo;re in the middle of doing something, because it&rsquo;s not designed to be particularly taxing.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s designed to exist as a subtle overlay over your current thinking and daily functioning, as opposed to a dedicated practice you do when you have 10 minutes to yourself.</p>\n\n<p>I tend to find the real benefit of this exercise comes from how we decide to focus on the right side of our vision.</p>\n\n<p>For example, you may want to physically look at something in the right side of your vision. Alternatively, you may decide to simply imagine something appearing in the right side of your vision.</p>\n\n<p>In a lot of cases, it can be as simple as acknowledging that you have a right arm. There&rsquo;s an infinite number of ways you can practice this exercise throughout the day.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, another important aspect of this exercise is consistency. Try to see how often and how long you can maintain your attention on the right side of your vision for.</p>\n\n<p>Not to mention, question why you think you&rsquo;ve been successful/unsuccessful in doing so.</p>\n\n<p>Do you get distracted when you attempt to focus your attention on the right side of your vision? Do you find it hard placing your focus on anything at all?</p>\n\n<p>Certainly, as with all awareness exercises, the more you practice them the better you&rsquo;ll become at training your mind to think in those terms.</p>\n\n<!-- \n<hr class=\"hr2\"/>\n\n<h2>Additional Resources</h2>\n\n<hr class=\"hr2__bottom\"/>\n\n\n\n\n\n  -->\n\n<!-- maybe link to other  -->\n","date":"2019-04-28","draft":false,"slug":"focus-your-attention-on-the-right-side-of-your-vision","categories":["awareness-over-all"],"tags":["practice","meditation","porn addiction","addiction","awareness","awareness exercises","perspective","nofap","neverfap","neverfap deluxe"],"permalink":"https://neverfapdeluxe.com/practices/focus-your-attention-on-the-right-side-of-your-vision/","overview":"","category":"Awareness over all","what":"Train your brain to focus in a simple and non-intrusive way.","how":"Focus your attention on the right side of our vision.","when":"Throughout the day while in the middle of doing something.","duration":"As long as you want.","section":"practices"},{"title":"What Can Your Hand Do?","page_id":"6f5a6c18-da7e-432f-94db-9733d5301df7","description":"Move your hands, fingers and arms around in order to test your creativity and see which combinations and arrangements you can come up with.","content":"<!-- VERY HAPPY WITH EDIT -->\n\n<p>This exercise is designed to help you think outside of the box.</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s not a particularly difficult exercise in the sense that it allows for unlimited creativity.</p>\n\n<p>However, it&rsquo;s an exercise that&rsquo;s very difficult to master in the traditional sense of being able to consistently replicate the same thing each time.</p>\n\n<p>I find I learn new things each time I try this exercise, and you&rsquo;ll be surprised at the extent to which you&rsquo;ll also discover new things each time you try it too.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>In this exercise what we'll be doing is coming up with a variety of different ways we can use our hands.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>How we can move them. Arrange them. Touch them.</p>\n\n<p>And in doing so, realise the extent to which we haven&rsquo;t been thinking before, or at least allowed ourselves the opportunity to think previously.</p>\n\n<p>Because although we use our hands everyday, it&rsquo;s not as if we think about them in certain odd ways, such as how we can arrange them into different shapes and patterns.</p>\n\n<p>I suppose it&rsquo;s a lot like when you&rsquo;re walking down a street you&rsquo;re familiar with, and you happen to notice something completely new that&rsquo;s always been there, yet you hadn&rsquo;t noticed up until that very moment.</p>\n\n<p>By practicing this exercise we can learn to not only think creatively, but also understand that no matter how much we think we know, we don&rsquo;t truly know it all.</p>\n\n<p>Something which often has to be experienced to be believed, hence this exercise.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr2\"/>\n\n<h2>Instructions</h2>\n\n<hr class=\"hr2__bottom\"/>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>To begin this exercise I want you to first look at your hand.</p>\n\n<p>What do you see? Take notice of the wrinkles on your knuckles. The hair on your fingers. The tone of your skin.</p>\n\n<p>Already, you&rsquo;re probably doing something unique. Chances are you&rsquo;ve never considered staring at your hand for an extended period of time, ever.</p>\n\n<p>Next try and move your fingers around. See if you can make your hand into weird shapes by moving your fingers into odd positions.</p>\n\n<p>What happens once you move your wrist as well? Does it feel natural? What is natural?</p>\n\n<p>Once you&rsquo;ve played around with that idea, get your other hand involved as well.</p>\n\n<p>What arrangements/combinations can you create with two hands? What if you interlace all your fingers together? What if you put both the backs of your hands together?</p>\n\n<p>Remember, this truly is an exercise of creativity, so the aim is to play around and see what you can come up with.</p>\n\n<p>Not only will it help open up your mind, but it will get you thinking about something which you ordinarily wouldn&rsquo;t be thinking about.</p>\n\n<p>No different to your recovery if you&rsquo;re just starting out.</p>\n\n<!-- \n<hr class=\"hr2\"/>\n\n<h2>Additional Resources</h2>\n\n<hr class=\"hr2__bottom\"/>\n\n\n\n\n\n  -->\n\n<!-- maybe link to other  -->\n","date":"2019-05-01","draft":false,"slug":"what-can-your-hand-do","categories":["awareness-over-all"],"tags":["practice","meditation","porn addiction","addiction","awareness","awareness exercises","perspective","nofap","neverfap","neverfap deluxe"],"permalink":"https://neverfapdeluxe.com/practices/what-can-your-hand-do/","overview":"","category":"Awareness over all","what":"Develop awareness by testing the limits of your creativity.","how":"Move your hand and fingers around into various shapes and patterns.","when":"Anytime.","duration":"1 - 2 minutes.","section":"practices"},{"title":"Focus On Your Finger And Your Background","page_id":"2bc4261b-a813-41d4-84e3-db0650ab07e0","description":"By shifting our visual attention, we can learn more about how the mind operates in regards to where we place our attention.","content":"<p>This is a simple exercise most people can benefit from straight-away without too much effort.</p>\n\n<p>Certainly, it was one of the first awareness exercises I learnt when I was starting out with my own mental health journey, and it&rsquo;s one that has stuck with me since.</p>\n\n<p>This exercise involves manipulating your visual field in order to change the depth perception of the objects in front of you, notably your finger and the foreground.</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s a powerful exercise because humans are largely visual creatures, and so to rapidly change our focus so vividly can help us better understand the power which we have over ourselves and our perception of reality.</p>\n\n<p>At a conscious level, we may not realise the extent to which we have control over ourselves and in particular our thoughts, feelings and even senses.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, demonstrating first-hand that we do have control over these things aspects of our consciousness is a great way to open our minds and dissolve some of the self-limiting beliefs we may have about what we&rsquo;re capable of as people.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, help us detach from the misconceptions within our own minds, including our ego and all things conceptual.</p>\n\n<p>And the fact that what we&rsquo;re doing here is conscious is really key here, as we&rsquo;re trying to demonstrate power over our mind through our actions.</p>\n\n<p>Because that&rsquo;s ultimately what awareness is all about - learning to use our minds effectively so we no longer allow our subconscious fears and behaviours to control who we are.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr2\"/>\n\n<h2>Instructions</h2>\n\n<hr class=\"hr2__bottom\"/>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>While the instructions for this exercise are simple, the real benefit comes from the introspection that comes from practicing this exercise.</p>\n\n<p>No different to any other awareness exercises.</p>\n\n<p>In order to practice this exercise, what you&rsquo;ll want to do is place your hand in front of your face with one finger pointing up.</p>\n\n<p>Essentially, have it far away enough so you can see your finger clearly, but not so close that&hellip; I&rsquo;m sure you get the drift.</p>\n\n<p>Now, what you&rsquo;ll want to do is focus on that finger. Simply focus your vision on that finger, and notice what you see.</p>\n\n<p>If practiced successfully, you should be able to see your finger very clearly. I mean, it is right in front of your face, afterall.</p>\n\n<p>Now, ask yourself a few questions. Are you able to focus on anything else while focusing on your finger? What about the background, are you able to focus on that as well?</p>\n\n<p>Once you&rsquo;ve done this for about a minute-or-so, I now want you to focus your attention on something in the background.</p>\n\n<p>It could be a tree. It could be something on you wall. Generally, the further away it is the better this works.</p>\n\n<p>And with your focus shifted, I want you to gauge your change of perspective and truly understand the significance of what you&rsquo;ve achieved here.</p>\n\n<p>With your focus on that object in the distance, what do you notice? Are you able to see your finger clearly at all?</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, this exercise teaches us a few different things.</p>\n\n<p>It teaches us that although we can have two objects in front of us, where we place our attention ultimately dictates what our experience will be.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, it also teaches us the importance that we play as individuals in regards to how we perceive reality.</p>\n\n<p>When we focused on the background, our finger itself didn&rsquo;t change. What changed was our perception of that finger, due to where we placed our attention.</p>\n\n<p>There are also a number of additional lessons we can learn from this exercise, however I&rsquo;ll leave that up to you to explore!</p>\n\n<!-- TODO: Maybe we need a takeaways section. -->\n\n<!--\n<hr class=\"hr2\"/>\n\n<h2>Additional Resources</h2>\n\n<hr class=\"hr2__bottom\"/>\n\n\n\n\n\n  -->\n\n<!-- maybe link to other  -->\n","date":"2019-05-07","draft":false,"slug":"focus-on-your-finger-and-your-background","categories":["choice-over-mind"],"tags":["practice","meditation","porn addiction","addiction","awareness","awareness exercises","perspective","nofap","neverfap","neverfap deluxe"],"permalink":"https://neverfapdeluxe.com/practices/focus-on-your-finger-and-your-background/","overview":"","category":"Choice over mind","what":"Learn about the significance of moving around our visual attention.","how":"Focusing on our finger in front of us.","when":"When we have a quiet moment to ourselves.","duration":"One minute per object.","section":"practices"},{"title":"Catch Out Your Judgements","page_id":"672c9a6f-af06-4f11-a0b3-ef93f57c63d1","description":"Catch Yourself Whenever You Find Yourself Making A Judgement.

Where you can mentally say to yourself:</p>\n\n<p><strong>&ldquo;Ah, so that&rsquo;s what my mind does when I react to a judgement. Duely noted.&rdquo;</strong></p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr2\"/>\n\n<h2>Instructions</h2>\n\n<hr class=\"hr2__bottom\"/>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>All we want to do with this exercise is catch ourselves and acknowledge when we&rsquo;ve made a judgement.</p>\n\n<p>Now, there&rsquo;s really only one recommended way that you approach this, which is to acknowledge the judgement as I briefly demonstrated above.</p>\n\n<p><strong>&ldquo;Ah, so that&rsquo;s what my mind does. Duely noted.&rdquo;</strong></p>\n\n<p>The idea behind acknowledgement is that we merely want to take note of it, without creating any further judgements.</p>\n\n<p>In essence we want to remain neutral, if not because you should be neutral in all your thoughts anyway.</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s part of what being calm and collected is all about.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, take note of your feelings at the point of judgement. Did you make the judgement because you were feeling angry? Was it because you were feeling depressed?</p>\n\n<p>The reason why this is important is because becoming aware of our feelings is often the easiest way to catch a judgement before it happens.</p>\n\n<p>Essentially, because most judgements produce some sort of feeling in some way, so there&rsquo;s usually a direct correlation between the two.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr4\"/>\n\n<h4>Ultimately, this is an exercise of observation, and observation is the skill we're trying to develop.</h4>\n\n<hr class=\"hr4__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>We&rsquo;re not doing this to feel justified that we caught a judgement. (which funnily enough is a judgement within itself)</p>\n\n<p>We&rsquo;re doing this so we can learn to become more aware of ourselves through observation, and really develop this skill so we can continue to remain aware into the future.</p>\n\n<p>And the sooner we can do this, the sooner we can gain control over our porn addiction.</p>\n\n<!-- \n<hr class=\"hr2\"/>\n\n<h2>Additional Resources</h2>\n\n<hr class=\"hr2__bottom\"/>\n\n\n\n\n\n  -->\n\n<!-- maybe link to other  -->\n","date":"2019-05-12","draft":false,"slug":"catch-out-your-judgements","categories":["uncondition-over-judgement"],"tags":["practice","meditation","porn addiction","addiction","awareness","awareness exercises","perspective","nofap","neverfap","neverfap deluxe"],"permalink":"https://neverfapdeluxe.com/practices/catch-out-your-judgements/","overview":"","category":"Uncondition over judgement","what":"Learn which specific situations cause us to be judgemental.","how":"Make a mental note and observe whenever we make a judgement of any kind.","when":"When you make a judgement.","duration":"2 - 10 seconds per observation.","section":"practices"}]
