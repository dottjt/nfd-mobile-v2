More that it&rsquo;s an exercise that can tend to produce more anger and frustration, than enlightenment.</p>\n\n<p>Although, that&rsquo;s also part of the challenge.</p>\n\n<p>This exercise is a bit like asking you to imagine what a cube would look like in 4D. It&rsquo;s not something we can inherently do provided our limited ability to perceive only in 3D.</p>\n\n<p>No matter how we try to think about it, we can provide no meaningful answer that will intuitively make sense based on our 3D understanding of the world.</p>\n\n<p>And part of the magic of this exercise is learning to come to terms with the fact that there is no perfect answer, let alone any coherent answer at all.</p>\n\n<p>This is where you&rsquo;ll discover the most benefit from practicing this exercise.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr2\"/>\n\n<h2>Instructions</h2>\n\n<hr class=\"hr2__bottom\"/>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>I want you to think about your mind.</p>\n\n<p>Your mind is what allows you to think, feel and perceive reality.</p>\n\n<p>When we bunch all these things together what we effectively create is our conscious experience.</p>\n\n<p>Now, I want you to ask yourself.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>Where does your consciousness come from?</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>Does your consciousness come from your mind? Does it come from your eyes? Is there any single point of consciousness you can pin point, in the cloud of sensation that you&rsquo;re currently experiencing?</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, I want you to attempt to do something profound. I want you to attempt to look at that which is perceiving.</p>\n\n<p>Which is to say, I want you to try and locate the centre of your consciousness.</p>\n\n<p>What does it look like? Is there even a centre? Is the centre merely temporary? Is there even a consciousness to locate at all?</p>\n\n<p>The difficulty of this exercise derives from the fact that it&rsquo;s incredibly difficult to interpret something you are.</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s a bit like asking someone to describe what they look like, when they&rsquo;ve never seen a reflection of themselves in the mirror.</p>\n\n<p>Now to add to the perplexity of the situation, imagine how frustrating it would be trying to describe what you look like, when you&rsquo;ve never even seen another human being before?</p>\n\n<p>That&rsquo;s a bit what this exercise is like, because we only have our own consciousness to relate to, and even then no one quite knows what it is.</p>\n\n<p>So not only does this exercise require an incredible amount of thinking outside of the box, however it&rsquo;s a thought exercise which may not even be possible at all.</p>\n\n<p>Regardless, like all awareness exercises the benefit comes from the process, so play around with the idea and see where it takes you.</p>\n\n<p>Certainly, none of it may make any sense at all, let alone ever.</p>\n\n<p>However the more you think about the idea, the easier it will become to remove those conceptual barriers and even come to a point of acceptance where this may make sense to you in some form, even if it doesn&rsquo;t directly address all your concerns.</p>\n\n<p>I highly encourage you stick with it for a few days at least.</p>\n\n<p>And see where it takes you.</p>\n\n<!-- \n<hr class=\"hr2\"/>\n\n<h2>Additional Resources</h2>\n\n<hr class=\"hr2__bottom\"/>\n\n\n\n\n\n  -->\n\n<!-- maybe link to other  -->\n","date":"2019-05-20","draft":false,"slug":"who-is-looking","categories":["choice-over-mind"],"tags":["practice","meditation","porn addiction","addiction","awareness","awareness exercises","perspective","nofap","neverfap","neverfap deluxe"],"permalink":"https://neverfapdeluxe.com/content_practices/who-is-looking/","overview":"","category":"Choice over mind","what":"Develop the ability to introspect your own existence by questioning the source of your consciousness.","how":"Try and locate your own consciousness.","when":"In a calm setting while alone.","duration":"For a few minutes at a time.","section":"content_practices"},{"title":"Catch Out Your Judgements","page_id":"672c9a6f-af06-4f11-a0b3-ef93f57c63d1","description":"Catch Yourself Whenever You Find Yourself Making A Judgement.

Where you can mentally say to yourself:</p>\n\n<p><strong>&ldquo;Ah, so that&rsquo;s what my mind does when I react to a judgement. Duely noted.&rdquo;</strong></p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr2\"/>\n\n<h2>Instructions</h2>\n\n<hr class=\"hr2__bottom\"/>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>All we want to do with this exercise is catch ourselves and acknowledge when we&rsquo;ve made a judgement.</p>\n\n<p>Now, there&rsquo;s really only one recommended way that you approach this, which is to acknowledge the judgement as I briefly demonstrated above.</p>\n\n<p><strong>&ldquo;Ah, so that&rsquo;s what my mind does. Duely noted.&rdquo;</strong></p>\n\n<p>The idea behind acknowledgement is that we merely want to take note of it, without creating any further judgements.</p>\n\n<p>In essence we want to remain neutral, if not because you should be neutral in all your thoughts anyway.</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s part of what being calm and collected is all about.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, take note of your feelings at the point of judgement. Did you make the judgement because you were feeling angry? Was it because you were feeling depressed?</p>\n\n<p>The reason why this is important is because becoming aware of our feelings is often the easiest way to catch a judgement before it happens.</p>\n\n<p>Essentially, because most judgements produce some sort of feeling in some way, so there&rsquo;s usually a direct correlation between the two.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr4\"/>\n\n<h4>Ultimately, this is an exercise of observation, and observation is the skill we're trying to develop.</h4>\n\n<hr class=\"hr4__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>We&rsquo;re not doing this to feel justified that we caught a judgement. (which funnily enough is a judgement within itself)</p>\n\n<p>We&rsquo;re doing this so we can learn to become more aware of ourselves through observation, and really develop this skill so we can continue to remain aware into the future.</p>\n\n<p>And the sooner we can do this, the sooner we can gain control over our porn addiction.</p>\n\n<!-- \n<hr class=\"hr2\"/>\n\n<h2>Additional Resources</h2>\n\n<hr class=\"hr2__bottom\"/>\n\n\n\n\n\n  -->\n\n<!-- maybe link to other  -->\n","date":"2019-05-12","draft":false,"slug":"catch-out-your-judgements","categories":["uncondition-over-judgement"],"tags":["practice","meditation","porn addiction","addiction","awareness","awareness exercises","perspective","nofap","neverfap","neverfap deluxe"],"permalink":"https://neverfapdeluxe.com/content_practices/catch-out-your-judgements/","overview":"","category":"Uncondition over judgement","what":"Learn which specific situations cause us to be judgemental.","how":"Make a mental note and observe whenever we make a judgement of any kind.","when":"When you make a judgement.","duration":"2 - 10 seconds per observation.","section":"content_practices"},{"title":"Focus On Your Finger And Your Background","page_id":"2bc4261b-a813-41d4-84e3-db0650ab07e0","description":"By shifting our visual attention, we can learn more about how the mind operates in regards to where we place our attention.","content":"<p>This is a simple exercise most people can benefit from straight-away without too much effort.</p>\n\n<p>Certainly, it was one of the first awareness exercises I learnt when I was starting out with my own mental health journey, and it&rsquo;s one that has stuck with me since.</p>\n\n<p>This exercise involves manipulating your visual field in order to change the depth perception of the objects in front of you, notably your finger and the foreground.</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s a powerful exercise because humans are largely visual creatures, and so to rapidly change our focus so vividly can help us better understand the power which we have over ourselves and our perception of reality.</p>\n\n<p>At a conscious level, we may not realise the extent to which we have control over ourselves and in particular our thoughts, feelings and even senses.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, demonstrating first-hand that we do have control over these things aspects of our consciousness is a great way to open our minds and dissolve some of the self-limiting beliefs we may have about what we&rsquo;re capable of as people.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, help us detach from the misconceptions within our own minds, including our ego and all things conceptual.</p>\n\n<p>And the fact that what we&rsquo;re doing here is conscious is really key here, as we&rsquo;re trying to demonstrate power over our mind through our actions.</p>\n\n<p>Because that&rsquo;s ultimately what awareness is all about - learning to use our minds effectively so we no longer allow our subconscious fears and behaviours to control who we are.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr2\"/>\n\n<h2>Instructions</h2>\n\n<hr class=\"hr2__bottom\"/>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>While the instructions for this exercise are simple, the real benefit comes from the introspection that comes from practicing this exercise.</p>\n\n<p>No different to any other awareness exercises.</p>\n\n<p>In order to practice this exercise, what you&rsquo;ll want to do is place your hand in front of your face with one finger pointing up.</p>\n\n<p>Essentially, have it far away enough so you can see your finger clearly, but not so close that&hellip; I&rsquo;m sure you get the drift.</p>\n\n<p>Now, what you&rsquo;ll want to do is focus on that finger. Simply focus your vision on that finger, and notice what you see.</p>\n\n<p>If practiced successfully, you should be able to see your finger very clearly. I mean, it is right in front of your face, afterall.</p>\n\n<p>Now, ask yourself a few questions. Are you able to focus on anything else while focusing on your finger? What about the background, are you able to focus on that as well?</p>\n\n<p>Once you&rsquo;ve done this for about a minute-or-so, I now want you to focus your attention on something in the background.</p>\n\n<p>It could be a tree. It could be something on you wall. Generally, the further away it is the better this works.</p>\n\n<p>And with your focus shifted, I want you to gauge your change of perspective and truly understand the significance of what you&rsquo;ve achieved here.</p>\n\n<p>With your focus on that object in the distance, what do you notice? Are you able to see your finger clearly at all?</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, this exercise teaches us a few different things.</p>\n\n<p>It teaches us that although we can have two objects in front of us, where we place our attention ultimately dictates what our experience will be.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, it also teaches us the importance that we play as individuals in regards to how we perceive reality.</p>\n\n<p>When we focused on the background, our finger itself didn&rsquo;t change. What changed was our perception of that finger, due to where we placed our attention.</p>\n\n<p>There are also a number of additional lessons we can learn from this exercise, however I&rsquo;ll leave that up to you to explore!</p>\n\n<!-- TODO: Maybe we need a takeaways section. -->\n\n<!--\n<hr class=\"hr2\"/>\n\n<h2>Additional Resources</h2>\n\n<hr class=\"hr2__bottom\"/>\n\n\n\n\n\n  -->\n\n<!-- maybe link to other  -->\n","date":"2019-05-07","draft":false,"slug":"focus-on-your-finger-and-your-background","categories":["choice-over-mind"],"tags":["practice","meditation","porn addiction","addiction","awareness","awareness exercises","perspective","nofap","neverfap","neverfap deluxe"],"permalink":"https://neverfapdeluxe.com/content_practices/focus-on-your-finger-and-your-background/","overview":"","category":"Choice over mind","what":"Learn about the significance of moving around our visual attention.","how":"Focusing on our finger in front of us.","when":"When we have a quiet moment to ourselves.","duration":"One minute per object.","section":"content_practices"},{"title":"What Can Your Hand Do?","page_id":"6f5a6c18-da7e-432f-94db-9733d5301df7","description":"Move your hands, fingers and arms around in order to test your creativity and see which combinations and arrangements you can come up with.","content":"<!-- VERY HAPPY WITH EDIT -->\n\n<p>This exercise is designed to help you think outside of the box.</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s not a particularly difficult exercise in the sense that it allows for unlimited creativity.</p>\n\n<p>However, it&rsquo;s an exercise that&rsquo;s very difficult to master in the traditional sense of being able to consistently replicate the same thing each time.</p>\n\n<p>I find I learn new things each time I try this exercise, and you&rsquo;ll be surprised at the extent to which you&rsquo;ll also discover new things each time you try it too.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>In this exercise what we'll be doing is coming up with a variety of different ways we can use our hands.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>How we can move them.
