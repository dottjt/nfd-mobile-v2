We feel obliged to do something about it, only to end up relapsing or doing something harmful like eat an entire bag of chips.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>However what people don't realise is that in 90% of cases, the correct thing to do is not react.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>In fact, that&rsquo;s part of the core tennant of what NeverFap Deluxe is all about, learning to remain calm and composed inspite of what you&rsquo;re feeling.</p>\n\n<p>To go into more detail, essentially 5% of our time should be spent practicing awareness via meditation, while the other 95% of our time should be spent remaining calm.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, the sooner you realise that you have no obligation to react, the sooner you&rsquo;ll be able to act more effectively out of principle.</p>\n\n<p>Another key thing to note about obligation is that it&rsquo;s merely a feeling.</p>\n\n<p>And by understanding that nothing is important, we can directly challenge this feeling in a way that bypasses it entirely.</p>\n\n<p>The sooner you learn to dismantle your ego and your thoughts, the quicker you&rsquo;ll be able to help yourself in a more constructive way.</p>\n\n<p>In particular, by remaining in control.</p>\n","date":"2019-06-02","draft":false,"slug":"the-trick-is-to-realise-that-nothing-is-important","categories":["balance-over-reward"],"tags":["context","judgement","porn addiction","addiction","awareness","awareness exercises","perspective","nofap","neverfap","neverfap deluxe"],"permalink":"https://neverfapdeluxe.com/content_articles/the-trick-is-to-realise-that-nothing-is-important/","tldr1":"Nothing is important, since everything relates to your ego.","tldr2":"Any opportunity to dissolve your ego is productive.","tldr3":"","tldr4":"","tldr5":"","section":"content_articles"},{"title":"The Importance Of Letting Go","page_id":"67819a08-abeb-40ee-921d-5959c66b1e4f","description":"This article describes the importance of letting go and how it relates to our ability to respond effectively.","content":"<p>Some people have a difficult time letting go.</p>\n\n<p>For example, some people will continue to latch onto negative feelings, regardless of whether these feelings are productive, let alone help us feel empowered about who who we are.</p>\n\n<p>Others have a hard time letting go of their own thoughts, as they find themselves paralyzed in indecision, stuck in a cycle of incessant rationality and self-judgement.</p>\n\n<p>Failure to let go may even extend to the toxic people in our lives, or even the self-limiting beliefs we have about ourselves, that we&rsquo;re simply &ldquo;not good enough&rdquo; or &ldquo;undeserving&rdquo; of love and attention.</p>\n\n<p>Regardless of what it is we&rsquo;re struggling with, the solution all points to the same thing.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>Learning to let go and learning to become free of these unproductive attributes.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>Of course, if it were as simple as walking away, none of us would have any problems and we&rsquo;d all be clear of our addiction and a-ok to continue with our lives.</p>\n\n<p>Well, today I&rsquo;m here to discuss not only the importance of letting go, but also how you can achieve this purpose by changing the way we think about attachment.</p>\n\n<p>Part of the reason why people struggle with letting go, is because there&rsquo;s a great fear and misunderstanding surrounding this idea of what letting go truly is.</p>\n\n<p>At first glance people will usually assume the worst.</p>\n\n<p>They&rsquo;ll view letting go as this process of inherently losing something.</p>\n\n<p>In particular, losing a part of themselves that they believe to be not only valuable, but irreplaceable.</p>\n\n<p>A part of themselves which they&rsquo;ve contributed towards for so long, that they can no longer distinguish between themselves from &lsquo;it&rsquo;.</p>\n\n<p>Under these circumstances, letting go then becomes this deep-seated fear of loss, potentially leaving this hollow shell of nothingness which we may end up regretting.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>Well, I'm here to tell you that this makes no sense what-so-ever.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>You see, you don&rsquo;t actually lose anything by letting go.</p>\n\n<p>There is no &lsquo;void&rsquo; once something leaves.</p>\n\n<p>If you think of the conscious human experience as a bunch of brain waves moving forward, those waves don&rsquo;t suddenly disappear the moment you let something go.</p>\n\n<p>Nor do you experience less waves, nor more.</p>\n\n<p>The only time this ever happens is when you die, and since you&rsquo;re still very much alive and conscious once you let go, nothing is even lost in a metaphysical sense.</p>\n\n<p>Those brain waves will still keep chugging along at the same rate as they did prior to when you didn&rsquo;t let go.</p>\n\n<p>So what actually happens then?</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>Well, what happens is that it allows you to experience different waves.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>Much like those brain waves which are being produced each second, it can help to think of the brain as a conveyor belt in an ice-cream factory.</p>\n\n<p>Regardless of which flavour of ice-cream you decide to produce, that conveyor belt is still going to be producing ice-cream none-the-less.</p>\n\n<p>If you think of all the awful things in your life as terrible flavours of ice-cream, then letting go of them isn&rsquo;t going to suddenly stop producing ice-cream.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, what happens is quite remarkable.</p>\n\n<p>What happens is that you begin producing neutral, vanilla ice-cream.</p>\n\n<p>Not worse ice-cream, just normal, plain ice-cream.</p>\n\n<p>And you know what? Plain ice-cream tastes a hell of a lot better than bad ice-cream.</p>\n\n<p>Which is to say that by letting go of those awful flavours, you essentially allow yourself the opportuinty to start from scratch and create new amazing ones.</p>\n\n<p>Put simply, you can&rsquo;t make great ice-cream from crap ice-cream.</p>\n\n<p>You need to start with neutral base and that&rsquo;s essentially what letting go provides.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>What people don't realise is that letting go is in fact an opportunity.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s an opportunity to experience something new. Something exciting. Something magical.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, half the challenge is that people remain so devoid of experiencing anything nice, that they therefore assume that these &lsquo;non-awful&rsquo; experiences simply don&rsquo;t exist.</p>\n\n<p>Well, they do - as long as you change your understanding of loss and fear in relation to letting go, as I&rsquo;ve mentioned in this article.</p>\n\n<p>Often what can help is to simply commit to the process without expectation. A lot of the time that&rsquo;s how I approach my gym workouts.</p>\n\n<p>Because sometimes feelings simply disagree. Sometimes you don&rsquo;t feel like working out, but that doesn&rsquo;t denote the importance of why you should be working out consistently.</p>\n\n<p>So how do you effectively let go?</p>\n\n<p>Well, like anything in life, it simply comes down to a matter of practice and consistency.</p>\n\n<p>There are quite a few exercises in our practices section of the NeverFap Deluxe website, which are designed to help dissolve your ego.</p>\n\n<p>And help you dissociate from your thoughts and feelings, so your ability to enact conscsious action can be exercised in full.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What Can Your Hand Do?</strong> and <strong>Stop Absolutely Everything You&rsquo;re Doing</strong> are good places to start for most people, although each exercise provides a different focus.</p>\n\n<p>Essentially, anything which can help you challenge that feeling of obligation you have not to let go, can certainly help on a cognitive and mental level.</p>\n\n<p>So get crackin&rsquo; buddy. Your mental health won&rsquo;t sort itself out without you.</p>\n","date":"2019-05-20","draft":false,"slug":"the-importance-of-letting-go","categories":["balance-over-reward"],"tags":["context","judgement","porn addiction","addiction","awareness","awareness exercises","perspective","nofap","neverfap","neverfap deluxe"],"permalink":"https://neverfapdeluxe.com/content_articles/the-importance-of-letting-go/","tldr1":"Learning to let go is one of the most important things we can do as human beings.","tldr2":"Essentially, you lose nothing by letting go.

Control over your actions. Control over your thoughts. Control over your feelings and emotions.</p>\n\n<p>Now, chances are that none of this is new to you.</p>\n\n<p>Chances are that you have been attempting self-control in some form or another for a while now, however it just hasn&rsquo;t quite worked out.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe your porn cravings still get the best of you. Maybe you feel as if you don&rsquo;t even have control over your mood and emotions.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe you&rsquo;ve completely normalised all these feelings and you don&rsquo;t believe that self-control is even possible.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr2\"/>\n\n<h2>Well, chances are that you've been doing it wrong this whole time.</h2>\n\n<hr class=\"hr2__bottom\"/>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Certainly, I was doing it completely wrong for the first five years of my porn recovery and there&rsquo;s absolutely nothing wrong with that.</p>\n\n<p>We all learn differently. We all have different life experiences.</p>\n\n<p>That&rsquo;s just how humans are.</p>\n\n<p>The thing to understand about self-control is that it&rsquo;s completely counter-intuitive.</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s counter-intuitive in the sense that since you don&rsquo;t have self-control, everything that you currently know has no relation to helping you understand self-control.</p>\n\n<p>Porn addicts don&rsquo;t know about self-control.</p>\n\n<p>Porn addicts know about being addicted to porn, because that&rsquo;s what they are.</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s what they live on a daily basis. It&rsquo;s how they understand and relate to the world around them.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>So there's a few steps we must take in order to address this.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>For starters, we need to learn self-control from someone who knows how.</p>\n\n<p>Which is easier said than done, because this then requires a change in attitude which you may not be used to.</p>\n\n<p>For example, in order to learn something from someone this entails both trust and commitment.</p>\n\n<p>Two things which porn addicts generally don&rsquo;t have.</p>\n\n<p>Porn addicts are generally skeptics and can barely commit to anything, since they don&rsquo;t already have control over their emotions.</p>\n\n<p>In part because they over-rely on their emotions, which change in an instant from &ldquo;I can do this!&rdquo; to &ldquo;Man, I really need to watch porn&rdquo;.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>So what hope is there?</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>Well, it can help to understand that no one is expecting you to beat this thing within a day.</p>\n\n<p>Overcoming porn addiction is the kind of thing which may take you years to understand.</p>\n\n<p>What the NeverFap method does is start you with small commitments, so that you can more easily work up to larger ones.</p>\n\n<p>A key thing to understand is that learning self-control, and really anything for that matter, isn&rsquo;t driven by goals and expectations.</p>\n\n<p>Learning is driven by the small things you do each day to practice it.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr2\"/>\n\n<h2>Instead, the problem is that you're spending so much time fighting these goals and expectations.</h2>\n\n<hr class=\"hr2__bottom\"/>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>That you don&rsquo;t feel motivated, nor even comfortable committing to these practices, due to fear, doubt and a whole trope of negative emotions.</p>\n\n<p>And you&rsquo;re fighting these goals and expectations, why?</p>\n\n<p>Well, as I said earlier.</p>\n\n<p>Self-control is counter-intuitive for those addicted to porn.</p>\n\n<p>Often the reason why we&rsquo;ve set these goals and expectations in the first place, is because that is what we understand will help us move forward.</p>\n\n<p>Chances are that this is what we learnt as kids, or perhaps it is all we have ever known.</p>\n\n<p>Again, there&rsquo;s absolutely nothing wrong with that.</p>\n\n<p>We&rsquo;re not here to judge, nor condemn. We&rsquo;re here to learn and become better people.</p>\n\n<p>In order to address this, the NeverFap method takes a strong focus on practicing meditation.</p>\n\n<p>Put simply.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>Meditation is the easiest and most effective way that I know how to develop self-control.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>The primary skill we will be learning in regards to meditation is observation.</p>\n\n<p>If I had to describe the most important skill you can learn to help you overcome your porn addiction, I would say that observation is that skill.</p>\n\n<p>Observation truly encompasses the default state of mind that you should be in almost all of the time.</p>\n\n<!--TODO: I talk more about it in this article Article on observation -->\n\n<p>And furthermore, developing observation is easy.</p>\n\n<p>For further information of the exercises and practices on this website, please head to our <a class=\"link\" href=\"/practices\">Practices</a> section.</p>\n\n<p>From there you can learn more about the various ways in which teach you self-control through meditation and various perspective exercises.</p>\n","date":"2019-05-01","draft":false,"slug":"what-is-neverfap","categories":["introduction"],"tags":["context","neverfap schedule","nofap schedule","porn addiction","addiction","awareness","nofap","neverfap","neverfap deluxe","neverfap basics"],"permalink":"https://neverfapdeluxe.com/content_articles/what-is-neverfap/","tldr1":"NeverFap Deluxe is designed to teach you self-control.","tldr2":"Self-control is counter-intuitive, because you are not already in control of yourself.","tldr3":"Observation is the most important skill you can learn in regards to overcoming porn addiction.","tldr4":"","tldr5":"","section":"content_articles"},{"title":"What To Do When You're Intensely Craving Porn","page_id":"d8e946b7-74cb-4598-aceb-ac052072e493","description":"The response when you're intensely craving porn is to relax and remain calm, no different to whether you're craving porn or not.","content":"<p>So, you find yourself in a desperate panic and all you can think about is nutting a big one out?</p>\n\n<p>Well, the response should always be the same, regardless of whether you&rsquo;re intensely craving porn, sitting at home in a calm state, or even completing an intense workout.</p>\n\n<p>As the guide states, calmness is a core tennant of the NeverFap Deluxe Method, which is to say that your job is to always remain calm and relaxed no matter what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>\n\n<p>If you&rsquo;re always relaxed and in-touch with your emotions, then there is no possible way that you can even begin to experience cravings at all.</p>\n\n<p>And the reason why you&rsquo;re experiencing those cravings to begin with is because you&rsquo;ve lost balance in some way i.e. you lost your cool.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>Put simply, there are no opportunities to experience cravings when you are relaxed.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>A key thing to understand about cravings is that they don&rsquo;t just happen all of a sudden, inspite of the fact that it may often feel like this is the case.</p>\n\n<p>In truth, the path towards developing those cravings were set many hours ago without you consciously realising it.</p>\n\n<p>And that&rsquo;s why I place such a heavy emphasis on developing awareness, because it&rsquo;s one of the most effective methods we have in regards to preventing ourselves from losing balance, so that we can identify these behaviours ahead of time and prevent them from taking place.</p>\n\n<p>Often it can be an incredibly small decision you made hours ago, which can have serious knock-on effects later down the track.</p>\n\n<p>For example, maybe you decided it would be okay to stay up late to pursue your work or hobbies, only to find yourself in a situation where you&rsquo;re now tired and have no control over your emotions.</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s just a priority thing. Maybe you thought it would be okay to spend just ten minutes more playing video games, only to find yourself stressed out trying to catch up with all your chores.</p>\n\n<p>There are many different ways we can lose balance, much of it (in most cases) largely obvious to you.</p>\n\n<p>Like, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re more than aware that staying up late affects your emotions, or that binge eating affects your energy levels.</p>\n\n<p>Well, I&rsquo;m asking you to take it a step further.</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;m asking you to consciously act on this knowledge and stop yourself from making these reckless decisions.</p>\n\n<p>Because I&rsquo;m here to tell you that there is no other alternative.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, when it comes down to it, this is all the NeverFap Deluxe Method really is. Replacing Unhealthy Coping Mechanisms with Healthy Coping Mechanisms so that you can achieve balance in life.</p>\n\n<p>A key misunderstanding a lot of people have with awareness is that it somehow gives you &ldquo;super powers&rdquo;.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>Like, you just practice your 10 minutes of meditation each day, and that suddenly makes you immune from everything.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>Absolutely incorrect.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, awareness is a tool that is designed to help you make it easier for you to do the hard (but right) thing, of consciously changing your thoughts and behaviours.</p>\n\n<p>There is no &ldquo;easy way&rdquo; or &ldquo;cheap hack&rdquo; to overcome porn addiction.</p>\n\n<p>At the end of the day, it fundamentally comes down to replacing Unhealthy Coping Mechanisms (such as watching porn) with Healthy Coping Mechanisms (meditation).</p>\n\n<p>With Healthy Coping Mechanisms you can have the most perfect two weeks of feeling as if you&rsquo;re completely invulnerable to the influence of porn.</p>\n\n<p>Only to breakdown into a puddle of mud the moment your mind decides to do a complete 180 and taunt you with your cravings for it.</p>\n\n<p>If you don&rsquo;t replace the habits, nothing will change.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>Like most things in life, there's good news and there's bad news.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>The bad news is that once you&rsquo;ve experienced an episode, there&rsquo;s very little you can do, because at that point you&rsquo;ve already lost balance and you&rsquo;re truly on your own at that point.</p>\n\n<p>Especially if you haven&rsquo;t yet developed the skills to calm down and not take your emotions personally.</p>\n\n<p>The good news is that there are a million ways we can learn not to lose balance, which means we can prevent ourselves from having those episodes at all.</p>\n\n<p>And this is arguably a much more effective strategy than trying to deal with our problems in a reactive way.</p>\n\n<p>With proper practice and by meditating daily, we can utterly crush this thing and leave your addiction in the dust.</p>\n\n<p>Please check out the Practices section to learn more.</p>\n","date":"2019-04-24","draft":false,"slug":"what-to-do-when-you-are-intensively-craving-porn","categories":["struggle-over-none"],"tags":["context","judgement","porn addiction","addiction","awareness","awareness exercises","perspective","nofap","neverfap","neverfap deluxe"],"permalink":"https://neverfapdeluxe.com/content_articles/what-to-do-when-you-are-intensively-craving-porn/","tldr1":"Your response in every situation is to remain calm.","tldr2":"Only through awareness can we identify behaviours which cause us to lose balance.","tldr3":"","tldr4":"","tldr5":"","section":"content_articles"},{"title":"What It Feels Like Not To Be Addicted To Porn","page_id":"74206abb-0de9-4f5c-a7d8-c0538befaf9f","description":"I explain what it feels like to no longer be addicted to porn.","content":"<p>One thing which people often ask me is:</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>What does it feel like not to be addicted to porn?</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>And it&rsquo;s an interesting question, because it&rsquo;s something I often think about and I think I&rsquo;ve finally found a way to convey this message accurately.</p>\n\n<p>If I had to provide an appropriate analogy which summarises what it feels like not to be addicted to porn, I would ask you to think back to when you were 7 years&rsquo; old.</p>\n\n<p>Now, for most people this is a rather distant memory.</p>\n\n<p>I personally remember very little about what my life was like back then, although if I had to approximate I would say that I was in Grade 2 and that I had a relatively simple life.</p>\n\n<p>I don&rsquo;t remember any particular details, the people in it, nor is it something which really evokes any sort of emotion, regret or anything.</p>\n\n<p>It just was a period of time within which I existed, no different to my existence now.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>Well, that memory kind of sums up how I also feel about my previous porn addiction.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>Which is to say that my porn addiction is a lot like a distant memory to me.</p>\n\n<p>While I remember the attachment and depression that resulted from it, I don&rsquo;t remember a whole lot of the specifics in terms of why I did it, nor even what it felt like.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, I don&rsquo;t really have any feelings towards it, since I haven&rsquo;t experienced the guilt, shame and sadness that arose from my habit in quite a very long time.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, you could say that it feels no different to being 7 years&rsquo; old.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>From a process point of view, it's actually quite astounding to understand why it's all a distant memory to me.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>For starters, I&rsquo;m obviously not watching porn.</p>\n\n<p>But let&rsquo;s really dig into what this actually means, because being a porn addict is so much more than just &lsquo;watching porn&rsquo; and turning into a pile of inconspicuous jelly.</p>\n\n<p>From a time perspective, I&rsquo;m no longer spending hours everyday looking at porn.</p>\n\n<p>Which not only means physically watching porn, but also dedicating time to watch porn which could otherwise be spent on more productive pursuits.</p>\n\n<p>Another aspect which people don&rsquo;t consider is the mental overhead of planning and organising that time as well.</p>\n\n<p>In my case, it meant consciously thinking about how I could masturbate to porn without my partner knowing, which not only affected my behaviour around her, but my mood as well if I hadn&rsquo;t orgasmed in a while.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>At it's worst, it was completely controlling my behaviour to a point of absolute obsession.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>There were times where I used to even do it at work, because I&rsquo;d had a bad day or I was feeling particularly desperate.</p>\n\n<p>I remember when I was working in a very confined office, I went as far as to walk to the local library so I could use my laptop and get a better image, rather than with my phone which I could afford to sneak into the toilet.</p>\n\n<p>You know, much like when I was absolutely obsessed with video games as a 7 year old, to a point where I would cry if my mother didn&rsquo;t let me play.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, it&rsquo;s funny to look back at these memories and certainly, as awkward as it is to admit some of these things, because I haven&rsquo;t relived these behaviours in such a long time, it no longer affects me personally.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>Certainly, the biggest thing that's changed is my mental state.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>The behaviours that arose from porn addiction aside, the thing which I&rsquo;ve noticed most is the improvement in my energy and mental state.</p>\n\n<p>You know that post-relapse dopamine brain-fog fun-land of hell?</p>\n\n<p>Well, that&rsquo;s truly a thing of the past and my mind is in a constant state of being level and clear, especially with my daily routine of meditation help balance things out.</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;m no longer irrationally depressed and my emotions are no longer tipping up and down, like a bunch of ADHD kids on a see-saw.</p>\n\n<p>But wow, what a difference.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>I distinctly remember that feeling of calm I felt when I first started meditating.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>It was mind-boggling. It was like I&rsquo;d finally felt peace and control for the first time in my porn recovery journey.</p>\n\n<p>It was at that point that I knew I would never be addicted to porn again, because I&rsquo;d finally discovered a way to effortlessly tame my mind.</p>\n\n<p>And that&rsquo;s another thing which a lot of people don&rsquo;t realise: When you overcome your porn addiction, life actually becomes easy and enjoyable.</p>\n\n<p>Because your emotions aren&rsquo;t all over the place, it becomes really easy to commit to your goals, and an amazing side effect of this is that you actually become happy.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>Like, not obsessive happy or manic happy, but just genuinely happy.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>The kind of happiness that doesn&rsquo;t ask anything of you, and which makes you feel completely at peace with yourself.</p>\n\n<p>While it&rsquo;s been a long and arduous journey getting to this point, I can definitely say that once you experience all these wonderful things, you&rsquo;ll never want to go back.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, the hard part is getting to a point where you finally do feel this kind of peace, which is why we emphasise the importance of practice and consistency.</p>\n\n<p>As long as you stick with the process, you will absolutely succeed with your goal of overcoming porn addiction.</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s also part of the reason why I&rsquo;ve put so much effort into crafting this website so that the process can make intuitive sense to you.</p>\n\n<p>I know you can do it.</p>\n\n<!-- For starters, it feels as if I never was addicted to porn.

Personally","page_id":"fd0b75c5-7c55-4b49-80ed-d55a4abde15d","description":"By refraining from reacting emotionally, we can learn not to take our emotions personally.","content":"<p>There are times when our emotions can feel unmanagable.</p>\n\n<p>For example, we may be feeling intensely anxious about a date we have planned for that night, or we may even be feeling trapped and under the pressure to perform well at school or in our jobs.</p>\n\n<p>All situations which pique our urge to masturbate or watch porn, to a point where we can&rsquo;t help but feel as if we have no choice but to give in.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, when we lose control over our emotions, we lose control over our ability to act effectively and it&rsquo;s these situations where we can begin to spiral down the path of relapse and helplessness.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>All situations where we collapse because we decide to give into our emotions and take them personally.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>And this really signifies the importance of why we shouldn&rsquo;t take our emotions personally.</p>\n\n<p>Not only in order to be effective with our emotions, however also because these situations are inevitably going to arise in the early stages of our recovery.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, shouldn&rsquo;t be used as an excuse or perceived barrier to our recovery, when it&rsquo;s something literally everyone goes through.</p>\n\n<p>For many of us, being unable to effectively manage our emotions forms part of the reason why we&rsquo;re still addicted to porn.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, learning to be able to effectively manage our emotions is usually the first hurdle most of us face when it comes to addressing our porn addiction.</p>\n\n<p>We have a craving, we hesitate, we attempt to postpone it (usually unsuccessfully), and then we eventually give in.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>It's where many of us are stuck mentally, and that's why I'm here to help.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>I want to start off by saying that learning not to take your emotions personally is actually a super simple process once you understand the dynamics of how we take things personally.</p>\n\n<p>Certainly, the first thing to understand about taking something personally is that it&rsquo;s often a subconscious response.</p>\n\n<p>Which is to say that it usually manifests itself as an instant emotional reaction, rather than as part of an informed decision we&rsquo;ve made prior to the emotion reaction.</p>\n\n<p>Otherwise we simply wouldn&rsquo;t bother with the drama, and we&rsquo;d avoid wasting all our energy getting worked up.</p>\n\n<p>Yet because we&rsquo;re largely not aware of our own behaviours which cause us to reach this point, we end up going down a dangerous path where we lose control over our emotions.</p>\n\n<p>Often because we&rsquo;ve simply never been taught otherwise.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>So what typically happens when we feel uncomfortable with our emotions, is that we try to assume control over them.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>Mentally on some level we think:</p>\n\n<p><strong>&ldquo;If I can force guilt or negativity onto myself, then I might be able to push myself to react differently.&rdquo;</strong></p>\n\n<p>or</p>\n\n<p><strong>&ldquo;If I try really hard to distract myself, then I&rsquo;ll forget about these feelings and they won&rsquo;t be able to affect me.&rdquo;</strong></p>\n\n<p>Essentially, we attempt to manipulate ourselves in the hope that it will help us achieve a positive end result.</p>\n\n<p>A common example of this (in the case of anxiety, for example) is to talk ourselves up as a form of motivation.</p>\n\n<p><strong>&ldquo;I can do it! There&rsquo;s no reason to feel sad at all!&rdquo;</strong></p>\n\n<p>We tell ourselves that we&rsquo;re smart, confident and in control - even though deep-down inside, our feelings are telling us otherwise.</p>\n\n<p>And so rather than making us feel better, it ends up making us feel worse about ourselves.</p>\n\n<p>In other cases, this can even manifest from anger and frustration:</p>\n\n<p><strong>&ldquo;F*ck you PMO! I will conquer you!&rdquo;</strong></p>\n\n<p>And the funny thing, is that none of these strategies work. In the end, it merely exhausts us as deep-down inside it&rsquo;s not what we actually believe about ourselves.</p>\n\n<p>So here&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re going to do.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>Instead, we're going to refrain entirely.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>And refraining from our emotions is the simplest way we can learn not take our emotions personally.</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s not the million dollar answer you were looking forward, however it is the correct approach in terms of learning to develop control over our minds.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, there are no cheap hacks.</p>\n\n<p>There are good practices and your commitment to them through practice and consistency.</p>\n\n<p>So to reiterate, the easiest way to deal with your emotions is to refrain from interacting with them.</p>\n\n<p>Now, where a lot of confusion comes from is this idea of what &ldquo;refraining&rdquo; truly means.</p>\n\n<p>For example, some people misconstrue it for meaning &ldquo;distraction&rdquo;.</p>\n\n<p>So in the case of being anxious, going and watching a calming YouTube video to cope with your difficult emotions.</p>\n\n<p>Now it&rsquo;s important that we really think about this.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>Because going and watching a calming YouTube video is actually a form of reaction.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s you reacting to your anxiety by indirectly finding an activity to preoccupy you from thinking about it.</p>\n\n<p>This directly contradicts this idea of refraining, which instead means to remain calm and relaxed in the face of these emotions.</p>\n\n<p>Which often means sitting there and choosing to consciously relax and engage in meditation, rather than find something to do to change what you&rsquo;re currently feeling.</p>\n\n<p>In layman&rsquo;s terms, refraining from taking your emotions personally is a bit like saying, &ldquo;Thank you, but no thank you.&rdquo; to your emotions.</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s a form of acknowledgement where you recognise that you&rsquo;re in control, without allow them to have power over you.</p>\n\n<p>Because when you react, you actually give that train of thought power.</p>\n\n<p>When you react what you&rsquo;re mentally communicating is.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>\"Yes, these feelings are valid and now I am going to address them and respond to them\".</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>Which is the opposite what we&rsquo;re trying to achieve with refraining from reaction at all.</p>\n\n<p>Now, while we&rsquo;ve covered a lot of theory in regards to refraining and why we shouldn&rsquo;t take things personally, actually practicing this is a different story.</p>\n\n<p>Essentially, in order to refrain effectively we must develop our skills of conscious awareness.</p>\n\n<p>The reason why this is important is that it will allow us to identify situations where we take our emotions personally, and instead learn to change those behaviours.</p>\n\n<p>And the only way we can develop our conscious awareness is by practicing awareness on a daily basis.</p>\n\n<p>We provide a variety of awareness exercises via the NeverFap Deluxe Practices section.</p>\n\n<p>Then, you&rsquo;l have a much easier time learning not to take your own emotions personally.</p>\n\n<p>As well as remain calm in the face of emotional uncertainty.</p>\n","date":"2019-04-03","draft":false,"slug":"the-easiest-way-to-not-take-our-emotions-personally","categories":["struggle-over-none"],"tags":["context","judgement","porn

one hidden judgement that porn addicts make the most, which leads to sabotage of our porn recovery journey.","content":"<p>Most porn addicts struggle with judgement, whether judging others or feeling judged themselves.</p>\n\n<p>Certainly, it&rsquo;s part of the reason why we fall into these cycles of watching porn, immediately criticising ourselves for our actions, which then makes us feel worse about ourselves, which then propels us to continue watching porn and continue masturbating in order to feel better.</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s a cycle I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re more-than familiar with, just as I once was.</p>\n\n<p>This response of self-criticism is one which often runs deep into how we think, as a habit which most people have developed since childhood.</p>\n\n<p>A habit which has become so prominent in our lives, that we simply don&rsquo;t even realise we&rsquo;re doing it much, if any of the time.</p>\n\n<p>Usually because when we make a judgement it can happen so quickly and so automatically.</p>\n\n<p>To a point where we may have even begun to view it as something normal, rather than something harmful that needs to be addressed.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>Especially, if it's a judgement directed at ourselves.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>Which is to say that we are our own worst critic.</p>\n\n<p>Whether through habits we developed from our parents or perhaps learnt via our own means, self-judgement is arguably one of the most harmful things we do as human beings.</p>\n\n<p>And it&rsquo;s the reason why we find ourselves stuck in these cycles of addiction, as well as feel terrible about ourselves, often for no reason at all.</p>\n\n<p>Essentially, many of us have a habit of telling ourselves off whenever we feel as if we&rsquo;ve done something wrong.</p>\n\n<p><strong>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t have stared at that woman.&rdquo;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t be feeling this way.&rdquo;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe I did that.&rdquo;</strong></p>\n\n<p>All trains of thought which lead to despair, hopelessness and self-harm i.e. watching porn.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, if reacting with judgement is all you know, then it will inherently feel like a natural thing to do, even inspite of reading these words.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>Well, I'm here to tell you today that it's not natural, and that it's a learnt habit no different to smoking everyday or being abusive towards others.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s an aspect of your personality which you have developed, and which you have likely reinforced every single day since you were young.</p>\n\n<p>Which is fine, because through awareness we can change these behaviours for the better.</p>\n\n<p>Certainly, I used to be incredibly self-critical up until my early 20s, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s the only way to think about life.</p>\n\n<p>The alternative on the other hand is not to judge, and instead, to refrain from having an opinion.</p>\n\n<p>Which may sound baffling to some, but it&rsquo;s also incredibly sound if you take the time to actually think about it.</p>\n\n<p>Which is to say that instead of reacting with judgement, the idea is to remain calm at all times.</p>\n\n<p>If not because remaining calm is what allows you to be effective with anything you do, whether it be working on your ambitions or simply being happy within the moment.</p>\n\n<p>So how do you get to this point?</p>\n\n<p>Essentially, by developing your awareness so you can catch those judgements as they happen, and in future prevent yourself from reacting at all.</p>\n\n<p>At first you&rsquo;ll only be able to catch yourself mid-judgement.</p>\n\n<p>However the longer you practice this, the better you&rsquo;ll be able to catch yourself ahead of time, and eventually the whole process will become so automatic that you won&rsquo;t even have to think about it.</p>\n\n<p>You will simply exist judgement free.</p>\n\n<p>There&rsquo;s a specific practice which helps target this called <strong>Catch Out Your Judgements</strong> in the practices section of the website.</p>\n\n<p>I highly recommend checking it

attention to the emotional reactions throughout the day is the easiest way to identify the judgements we have throughout .","content":"<p>Some people have a hard time identifying the judgements they make on a daily basis.</p>\n\n<p>It could be because they judge out of habit and therefore are doing it subsciously without realising it, or perhaps because they&rsquo;re simply unable to recognise a judgement once they&rsquo;ve made one.</p>\n\n<p>Certainly, I had no idea about the extent to which I was subsconsiously making judgements, and it took me years to personally identify them all and dissolve the negative habit for good.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, I&rsquo;m writing this article today so you can have a much easier time identifying the judgements you make on a daily basis, so you can live your life relatively burden free.</p>\n\n<p>Essentially, it all comes down to a super simple technique we can use to instantly identify the judgements we make throughout the day.</p>\n\n<p>And furthermore, it&rsquo;s a technique that doesn&rsquo;t require paying a therapist hundreds of dollars per hour for the privilege.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>The technique is to pay attention to your emotional reactions.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>Your emotion reactions are a key indicator of whether you&rsquo;ve made a judgement or not, and in order to understand how this works, we need to understand what emotional reactions are.</p>\n\n<p>For starters, emotional reactions don&rsquo;t simply appear out of thin air.</p>\n\n<p>They exist as a reaction to an event, usually in regards to a thought we have about something.</p>\n\n<p>Enter judgements.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>You see, judgements are much more than mere thoughts.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>If they were just like any other thought, then much like most other thoughts we have, they would disappear completely from our conscious never to bother us again.</p>\n\n<p>For example, while most of us are unable to remember any thoughts or opinions we had of the weather more than a few weeks ago, let alone the day before.</p>\n\n<p>Most of us can probably remember a time when our parents made us do something that upset us greatly, even if these events may have taken place more than a decade ago.</p>\n\n<p>In essence, what makes judgements different is that unlike typical thoughts that come and go, judgements are thoughts that we have put significant faith into and belief into.</p>\n\n<p>And it&rsquo;s this reason why they can be so destructive.</p>\n\n<p>For example, a lot of us make the judgement that we&rsquo;re not good enough and that we should try harder as a result (also known as self-criticism).</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>And when we make these judgements, we dictate how we're going to react on an emotional level.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>We come up with these deterministic narratives like:</p>\n\n<p><b>&ldquo;If that person doesn&rsquo;t shut up, I&rsquo;m going to get so mad!&rdquo;</b></p>\n\n<p><b>&ldquo;If I fail this test, I&rsquo;m going to feel so helpless and depressed.&rdquo;</b></p>\n\n<p>In a lot of cases, we won&rsquo;t even necessarily vocalise these agreements and instead, we&rsquo;ll imply them in our actions.</p>\n\n<p>For example, we might get really tense when we&rsquo;re mad or stressed.</p>\n\n<p>And what can happen over time is that we may not even generate the thought or physica response anymore, and simply skip straight to the emoiton.</p>\n\n<p>For example, feeling sad because we don&rsquo;t have a girlfriend, or getting upset because things aren&rsquo;t going our way.</p>\n\n<p>Certainly, these hidden agreements form part of the reason why these judgements can be so hard to identify, because often they take place completely out of conscious sight.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>Yet from the perspective of our emotional reactions, they are never hidden.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<!-- UP TO HERE, WILL NEED TO FINISH -->\n\n<p>Because although these agreements and beliefs are often hidden, the direct effect of those judgements are fully felt via the emotional reactions which shut us down and hold us completely at ransom.</p>\n\n<p>Via the emotional horror that pursues.</p>\n\n<p>This is when we feel the effect of those judgements most, and so paying attention to what you&rsquo;re feeling can be a key indicator as to whether you&rsquo;re making a judgement or not.</p>\n\n<p>Only until we can identify these judgements through our emotional reactions, can we finally move on and learn not to react, instead choosing to remain calm and level-headed.</p>\n\n<!-- TODO: Article to talk about how to truly identify judgement -->\n\n<p>Of course, you&rsquo;re probably wondering. I&rsquo;m making all these judgements, but what can I actually do about them?</p>\n\n<p>How is identifying them going to help?</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>Well, the great thing is that we don't need to go any further than simple acknowledgement.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>Because anything further you do at this point, is unnecessary rationalisation which is the exact opposite of what we are trying to achieve, which is to learn to let go and remain relaxed.</p>\n\n<p>Effectively, what we want to do is learn to let go of these judgements, and learn to simply function regardless of them.</p>\n\n<p>Where people often go wrong is that they feel trapped once they&rsquo;ve identified these judgements, as if they&rsquo;ve done some great evil, feeling the need to dissect them or rectify these behviours and habits.</p>\n\n<p>The funny thing is that this behaviour within itself is an emotional reaction, brought about by judgement. For example, you may have the judgement that you&rsquo;re not good enough, and therefore feel the need to do something about it.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>This in part signifies the extent to which a lot of the judgements are simply subconscious habit.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>As well as why it&rsquo;s important that we address these judgements and hidden agreements now, rather than let them continue to develop.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, many of us have been making these judgements since childhood, so it won&rsquo;t happen overnight.</p>\n\n<p>Just remember that no matter our emotional reaction or judgement, our go-to response is to acknowledge that we&rsquo;ve experienced an emotional reaction due to judgement, and to simply move on.</p>\n\n<p>Once you acknowledge something, not only does it help take you out of the reaction, which helps you in terms of remaining calm and refraining from reacting further.</p>\n\n<p>However it helps build your self-awareness and ability to identify these judgements in future.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, like anything practice makes perfect.</p>\n\n<p>And by using healthy coping mechanisms such as meditation and awareness exercises, we can go a long way towards developing control over our judgements and emotions.</p>\n","date":"2019-02-24","draft":false,"slug":"the-easiest-way-to-identify-a-judgement","categories":["uncondition-over-judgement"],"tags":["context","judgement","porn addiction","addiction","awareness","awareness exercises","perspective","nofap","neverfap","neverfap deluxe"],"permalink":"https://neverfapdeluxe.com/content_articles/the-easiest-way-to-identify-a-judgement/","tldr1":"The easiest way to identify a judgement is by paying attention to our emotional reactions.","tldr2":"In addition, it's important that we don't react once we do identify an emotional reaction.","tldr3":"","tldr4":"","tldr5":"","section":"content_articles"},{"title":"Your Porn Addiction Is Not Who You Are","page_id":"0e87d3fb-31a4-4f3e-b808-9a98c2c637af","description":"You porn addiction and your feelings about porn are completely separate from who you actually are.","content":"<!-- Written, just need to update metadata. -->\n\n<!-- Will Need One Edit -->\n\n<p>Porn addicts often struggle to dissociate themselves from their addiction.</p>\n\n<p>In part because porn addiction plays on a very primal, and natural human response.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>Otherwise known as attraction.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>After all, what is the difference between being attracted to a person in front of you, as opposed to a person on your computer screen doing rather promiscuous things?</p>\n\n<p>According to your brain, there really isn&rsquo;t much of a distinguishable difference at all.</p>\n\n<p>What this effectively does is have us question whether we&rsquo;re truly addicted at all.</p>\n\n<p>You know, because being attracted to other human beings is just one of those things that we seem to do by design, so what then seems to be the big deal?</p>\n\n<p>Which expresses itself into edging, claiming that porn is in fact &lsquo;art&rsquo;

NeverFap is that it&rsquo;s designed to make addressing your porn addiction easy.</p>\n\n<p>On a very low level it&rsquo;s about learning to co-exist with your emotions, in order to both avoid experiencing porn cravings altogether, as well as remain neutral when they do arise.</p>\n\n<p>And when you&rsquo;re not taking anything personally and you&rsquo;re not allowing any external influences from changing the way you think and feel&hellip;</p>\n\n<p>Well, I couldn&rsquo;t possibly think of anything more effortless than that.</p>\n\n<p>I truly believe that successful porn recovery requires an effortless approach in order to be effective, which is why I have designed NeverFap to be as effortless as possible.</p>\n\n<p>If I had to use one word to describe what NeverFap encompasses.</p>\n\n<p>I would use the word:</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>Calm.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>Calm is the default NeverFap state of mind.</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s not about being excited, determined or ready to dominate the world with your new-found energy.</p>\n\n<p>Those things will not help you sustainably overcome porn addiction.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, it&rsquo;s about being calm.</p>\n\n<p>When you practice the NeverFap Deluxe exercises everyday and apply them to your life, it makes you feel calm and collected.</p>\n\n<p>In large part because when you practice these exercises which provide you with the required skills and abilities to control your mind, you no longer fear the unknown.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr4\"/>\n\n<h4>Because you know that you have a strategy in place, and you know exactly what to expect from your ability to address your addiction.</h4>\n\n<hr class=\"hr4__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>Another part of the reason why being calm and collected is important, is because it becomes really difficult to self-harm or react emotionally when you&rsquo;re feeling calm.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, it becomes almost impossible.</p>\n\n<p>Which is exactly what we want, and is part of the reason why calmness is so wonderful within itself.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>Because remaining calm doesn't require any effort.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>In it&rsquo;s truest sense, calmness itself is a lack of effort.</p>\n\n<p>Calmness is the result of letting go of all your thoughts and simply just being.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, it&rsquo;s only possible not to be calm if you&rsquo;re actively doing something to disrupt it.</p>\n\n<p>Whether it be obsessive thinking, feeling or judging - all these things serve to disrupt our default state of being calm.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, you may struggle to remain calm because you&rsquo;ve built this habit of obsessively thinking and judging everything around you.</p>\n\n<p>That&rsquo;s okay too.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>It's simply a matter of following your daily routine of NeverFap Deluxe Practices.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>By commiting to meditation and practices which teach you self-control over your mind, you&rsquo;re making changes to how you think and feel.</p>\n\n<p>And the longer you commit to practicing each and everyday.</p>\n\n<p>The more you change and the closer you get to experiencing completely calmness in your life.</p>\n\n<p>So what are you waiting for?</p>\n\n<p>I recommend checking out our list of <a class=\"link\" href=\"\">NeverFap Deluxe Practices</a> for a list of exercises you can do to develop calmness in your life.</p>\n\n<!-- \nOften, our level of

basis.</p>\n\n<p>Certainly, while those other practices are incredibly useful in developing new perspectives, they are merely supplementary.</p>\n\n<p>The aim is that once you feel you have a grasp of <a class=\"link\" href=\"/practices/observe-your-senses\">Observe Your Senses</a>, you can start adding additional exercises to your routine.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>Personally speaking, I don't recommend doing more than one additional exercise at a time.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>Which is to say that an ideal routine will consist of doing <u>Observe Your Senses</u> along with one other additional exercise.</p>\n\n<p>Usually it makes sense to commit to these additional exercises for a week, before switching to something else.</p>\n\n<p>Just because doing it only for a day, won&rsquo;t teach us very much in terms of how changing the way we think will truly affect us long-term.</p>\n\n<p>But of course, finding out what personally works for you is important as well.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr2\"/>\n\n<h2>My Personal NeverFap Routine</h2>\n\n<hr class=\"hr2__bottom\"/>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>I have a very basic routine which works really well for me.</p>\n\n<p>Essentially, I spend around 40 minutes each day towards developing my awareness.</p>\n\n<p>With a few small key points throughout the day where I periodically zone out and just embrace calm.</p>\n\n<p>Here&rsquo;s how I would break it down:</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hrul\"/>\n\n<ul>\n<li><b>15 minutes of meditation as I walk to the train station in the morning for work.</b></li>\n<li><b>15 minutes of meditation as I walk to the train station in the morning for work.</b></li>\n<li><b>10 minutes of meditation while sitting down in a room, around 15 minutes before bed.</b></li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr class=\"hrul__bottom\"/>\n\n<p>This is the routine that I personally find works superbly well for me, in part because I don&rsquo;t need to necessarily go out of my way to make it happen.</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;ve simply adapted meditation to my everyday life, and that&rsquo;s what I recommend you do as well.</p>\n\n<p>In almost all cases, I am practicising observation of some kind, although usually encompassing different variations.</p>\n\n<p>I may focus on a very particular sense.</p>\n\n<p>In other cases, I may simply focus on emptying the thoughts from my mind.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>Regardless, I keep it super simple and that's why it works.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>Another thing to consider is self-care.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, the reason why NeverFap works as a solution is because the core philosophy behind it is quite simple.</p>\n\n<p>And self-care is simply another aspect we can focus on, to make things even simpler.</p>\n\n<p>Certainly, this isn&rsquo;t a focus of this website, so you can certainly do your own research into this.</p>\n\n<p>However below is a list of what I personally do to maintain self-care in my life.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hrul\"/>\n\n<ul>\n<li>I eat paleo.</li>\n<li>I do cardio and lift weights three times a week.</li>\n<li>I have a consistent sleep routine.</li>\n<li>I work on my hobbies and ambitions in my spare time.</li>\n<li>I play video games and watch TV to relax.</li>\n<li>I meditate approximately three times a day.</li>\n<li>I work a typical nine-to-five job.</li>\n<li>I brush my teeth in the morning and at night.</li>\n<li>I have a cold shower every night.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr class=\"hrul__bottom\"/>\n\n<p>The extent to which you maintain self-care is entirely up to you.</p>\n\n<p>In any case, I hope this post has helped you better understand what you can expect from a consistent never</p>\n\n<p>I encourage you to start small and simply commit to 10 minutes of meditation each day.</p>\n\n<p>That&rsquo;s precisely how I started and to be quite honest, spending 10 minutes each day was enough for me to see significant changes in the way I thought over the space of a few weeks.</p>\n\n<p>So don&rsquo;t feel as if you need to commit all your time to doing this.</p>\n\n<p>Remember, it&rsquo;s not how much you practice that counts, but what you practice that matters.</p>\n\n<p>In particular, if you feel as if you&rsquo;re struggling to find time to commit to your mental health, I highly recommend reading my article <a

mental health should always be a priority, no matter what. Compromising on that priority results in mental illness and contributes towards porn addiction.","content":"<!-- Very Happy With Edit -->\n\n<p>There&rsquo;s one excuse that I often see porn addicts come up with in regards to their addiction.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>I don't have enough time.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>Usually, it means time to spend towards addressing their porn addiction or mental health issues.</p>\n\n<p>After all, we&rsquo;re all incredibly busy people. We have things to do. Ambitions to fulfil. I mean, what does any of this have to do with porn addiction?</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s an attitude which quite ironically, prevents us from actually focusing on what&rsquo;s important in life.</p>\n\n<p>Which is why we&rsquo;re talking about it today.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>Because if you did have enough time to spend towards addressing your porn addiction, you simply wouldn't be a porn addict.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>So what exactly does it mean to not have enough time?</p>\n\n<p>Well, that&rsquo;s entirely up to you.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s because you feel compelled to always be in a state of constant &ldquo;productivity&rdquo;, and that time spent working on your mental health doesn&rsquo;t seem productive.</p>\n\n<p>Or perhaps, it&rsquo;s merely the feeling of productivity you crave.</p>\n\n<p>For example, checking your phone every five minutes to see if someone&rsquo;s messaged you over Facebook.</p>\n\n<p>On the otherhand, you may just be so obsessed with your goals and ambitions, that everything else which sits outside of those goals is seen as being irrelevant.</p>\n\n<p>Regardless of your interpretation, I&rsquo;m here to tell you that thinking that you do not have enough time for your mental health is a disorder.</p>\n\n<p>That is correct.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr2\"/>\n\n<h2>If you believe that you do not have enough time for your mental health then you have a mental disorder.</h2>\n\n<hr class=\"hr2__bottom\"/>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s a mental disorder because it&rsquo;s a choice to willingly neglect one&rsquo;s mental health, due to habit and desire.</p>\n\n<p>And there are never any valid reasons why anyone should ever neglect their own mental health.</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s the most important thing you have, and it&rsquo;s incredibly difficult not to suffer when you don&rsquo;t have your mental health in order.</p>\n\n<p>The moment you compromise on your mental health is when you introduce the potential to suffer.</p>\n\n<p>Although perhaps you&rsquo;d rather suffer just to satisfy that feeling of productivity or get that extra bit further with your ambitions.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>Again, ask yourself how this mentality isn't a sign of having a disorder.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>Part of this disorder consists of valuing time over quality of life.</p>\n\n<p>So a question worth asking is:</p>\n\n<p><u><b>What is time without your mental health?</b></u></p>\n\n<p>Without mental health, time becomes an uncontrollable struggle of judgement, self-criticism and depression.</p>\n\n<p>Instead of having control over what we think and feel, we instead find ourselves taking everything personally and feeling helpless to absolutely everything in our life.</p>\n\n<p>Without our mental health, days may seem like years in situations we largely find unbearable, which has the possibility to become any situation because that is no longer for us to decide.</p>\n\n<p>Without our mental health, life becomes very difficult.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr4\"/>\n\n<h4>Of course, there's a reason why poor mental health is often described as a self-repeating cycle.</h4>\n\n<hr class=\"hr4__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>We choose to obsess over something which we believe will make us happy i.e. addiction, uncheked ambitions etc.</p>\n\n<p>We worship that activity with our effort and time, believing it will make us feel better about ourselves.</p>\n\n<p>We end up feeling empty once the obsession wears off, inspite of all the time we spent believing in these solutions.</p>\n\n<p>Then we go and repeat the cycle again and again and again.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr2\"/>\n\n<h2>And to be honest, it's a bit shit.</h2>\n\n<hr class=\"hr2__bottom\"/>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>I&rsquo;m sure you think so too.</p>\n\n<p>All because we don&rsquo;t believe we have enough time to actually commit to something which will know will improve our frame of mind.</p>\n\n<p>Although perhaps you don&rsquo;t really see the point to doing things which may or may not improve your mental well-being.</p>\n\n<p>Certainly, I don&rsquo;t blame you.</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s hard to evaluate anything when your emotions are completely out of whack, and you genuinely believe that pursuing the same behaviours again and again will truly be &ldquo;different this time&rdquo; despite producing the exact same results of hope and depression in what seems to be a never ending cycle.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr4\"/>\n\n<h4>But let me say that there's never a bad time to commit to your mental health.</h4>\n\n<hr class=\"hr4__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>One key thing to understand about mental health is that it&rsquo;s accumulative.</p>\n\n<p>And the true beauty of mental health is that everything you&rsquo;ve done up until now to negatively impact your mental health is completely irrelevant.</p>\n\n<p><u><strong>For the only thing which truly matters is that which you do today.</strong></u></p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, it&rsquo;s about focusing on what you can do today, and this is the key to breaking this habit of never committing to your mental health.</p>\n\n<p>Realising that mental health isn&rsquo;t achieved by what you don&rsquo;t do, but rather by what you can do today.</p>\n\n<!--\nThe other thing which makes pursuing mental health so much more accessible than pursing obsession or addiction, is that it doesn't operate in the same way.\n\nWhich is to say that you don't achieve good mental health by spending five hours a day meditating in an attempt to undo years of self-harm.\n\nThat's not how it works at all.\n\nThe way mental health works is by commiting a bit of your time each day towards. -->\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>Honestly, spending ten minutes at night before bed meditating is all most people need.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, however.</p>\n\n<p>If you don&rsquo;t truly believe or understand why your mental health is more important than anything else in your life.</p>\n\n<p>Then you&rsquo;re going to continue to pursue activities which will conflict with your mental health.</p>\n\n<p>Just remember that whatever other things you achieve in place of your mental health, can never replace mental health itself.</p>\n\n<p>Which is to say that your achievements outside of mental health will never serve as a true solution to your problems.</p>\n\n<p>And when you do decide to work on your mental health, you may very well discover that everything you&rsquo;ve pursued up until then has been utterly pointless.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr2\"/>\n\n<h2>From this point of view, you have nothing to gain from neglecting your mental health.</h2>\n\n<hr class=\"hr2__bottom\"/>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>No matter what other benefits those other achievements may provide.</p>\n\n<p>Because in the overall scheme of things, your mental health is what determines how you feel, not your achievements.</p>\n\n<p>So in the overall scheme of things, 10 minutes, or even an hour a day spent working on your mental health is miniscule, compared to the benefits it will provide in helping you better understand yourself.</p>\n\n<p>Moving forward, I recommend checking out our list of <a class=\"link\" href=\"\">NeverFap Deluxe Practices</a> for a list of exercises you

Principles of NeverFap are a series of guidelines which can help you better handle your porn addiction.","content":"<!-- Very Happy With Edit -->\n\n<p>To be quite honest, the five principles are quite arbitrary.</p>\n\n<p>Which is to say that they&rsquo;re meaningless until you develop a personal understanding of how they apply to your own life.</p>\n\n<p>While my article <a class=\"link\" href=\"/articles/the-five-fundamental-principles-of-neverfap\">The Five Fundamental Principles of NeverFap</a> is a good introduction into what they are, today I want to talk about what they actually mean in my own everyday life.</p>\n\n<p>Because theory is one thing, however you may derive additional benefit from understanding how this theory applies to everyday situations.</p>\n\n<p>Hopefully you can relate.</p>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 3rem;\" class=\"five__principles__list__page\">\n  <span><div class=\"five__principles__item__page\">01 - Choice over mind</div></span>\n</div>\n\n<p>Choice over mind reminds me that I&rsquo;m always in control of myself.</p>\n\n<p>It reminds me that I have the ability to control how I feel, control what I do, as well as control my reaction to life itself.</p>\n\n<p>Essentially, it&rsquo;s a principle which gives me confidence over my porn addiction.</p>\n\n<p>It gives me the confidence to understand that no matter what, I ultimately decide what my relationship with porn is.</p>\n\n<p>I understand that if I struggle with porn, it&rsquo;s not because I&rsquo;ve lost control (in part because it&rsquo;s not possible to lose control, as opposed to simply making a bad decision).</p>\n\n<p>But rather, because I&rsquo;m understanding some aspect of myself, which is causing me to struggle in some way.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, having this understanding helps me not take my relationship with porn personally.</p>\n\n<p>So in summary, Choice over mind helps me maintain that vital &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always got this&rdquo; mentality.</p>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 3rem;\" class=\"five__principles__list__page\">\n  <span><div class=\"five__principles__item__page\">02 - Balance over reward</div></span>\n</div>\n\n<p>Balance over reward is perhaps the one principle I struggle with most.</p>\n\n<p>As an entrepeneur of sorts, I&rsquo;m rather obsessed with getting stuff done. As a result, I tend to overwork myself and even worse, develop mania and obsession in order to maintain this productivity.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, I struggle with bipolar disorder.</p>\n\n<p>And let me tell you, it is almost impossible to overcome something like porn addiction, when your emotions are completely out of whack.</p>\n\n<p>Yet, there is a solution.</p>\n\n<p>Essentially, by embracing balance as a fundamental principle, I&rsquo;ve been able to avoid getting to a point of complete mania and obsession, and therefore not experience those highs and lows which derail long-term goals such as refraining from porn.</p>\n\n<p>What does this entail?</p>\n\n<p>Obviously, meditation helps significantly in terms of training my mind to be calm.</p>\n\n<p>However I would say the biggest thing that helps is simply realising when I need to stop working.</p>\n\n<p>Previously, I would continue working and writing up until before I had to go to bed, which would result in sleepless nights and would even result in &lsquo;coding nightmares&rsquo;.</p>\n\n<p>What usually happens now on the other hand, is that I will simply stop doing any work around an hour and a half before bed, and that does a fine job of preventing mania and obsession from fully taking hold.</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes I may still slip into mania if I&rsquo;ve been working particularly hard up until then, however the hour and a half is enough for me to calm down and switch my mind off.</p>\n\n<p>During that time I usually stretch, meditate and relax (usually by playing video games or watching YouTube videos).</p>\n\n<p>Initially it was really hard to stop myself from working.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, the very idea of forcing myself to play video games and not work was something that I found hilarious, but I also knew that if I didn&rsquo;t relax, I&rsquo;d ultimately be doing my mental health a disservice.</p>\n\n<p>Now that I have this balance in my life however, I have much more control over my emotions and my attitude towards productivity has changed.</p>\n\n<p>I now realise that I am more productive by being balanced, and that I have more control over my life as a result.</p>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 3rem;\" class=\"five__principles__list__page\">\n  <span><div class=\"five__principles__item__page\">03 - Awareness over all</div></span>\n</div>\n\n<p>I love being aware of my feelings and emotions.</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s like having a super power where you can instantly recognise what is happening within your head at any moment in time.</p>\n\n<p>Awareness helps me with my porn addiction by allowing me to recognise behaviours and trends ahead of time, so I don&rsquo;t get stuck within them.</p>\n\n<p>What this means for me is recognising what I should be paying attention to in different situations.</p>\n\n<p>In that sense, Awareness is like that big brother which helps keep you together.</p>\n\n<p>That thing which helps ground you and which allows you to default to a healthy coping mechanism, instead of splurging on porn and excess.</p>\n\n<p>It is what allows me to always be in control, as well as remain calm and collected irregardless of what may be happening external to my brain.</p>\n\n<p>For example, If I&rsquo;m on public transport and there are a lot of pretty women around, I remind myself that I just need to effortlessly relax and focus on myself.</p>\n\n<p>If I&rsquo;m feeling stressed, I remind myself to time out and go for a walk.</p>\n\n<p>Awareness is like a sedative that makes you more awake.</p>\n\n<p>It is what helps me cope effortlessly when life is difficult, and I simply couldn&rsquo;t see myself not being a porn addict without it.</p>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 3rem;\" class=\"five__principles__list__page\">\n  <span><div class=\"five__principles__item__page\">04 - Struggle over none</div></span>\n</div>\n\n<p>Struggle over none is all about understanding that which we misunderstand.</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s about understanding that we do have choice over what happens in life, and that there&rsquo;s no reason what-so-ever to take it personally when we feel out of control.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, it&rsquo;s about having empathy for yourself.</p>\n\n<p>We all have periods where we struggle.</p>\n\n<p>We may be struggling with how to deal with others. We may be struggling with a difficult problem we&rsquo;ve been tasked to solve at work. We may even be struggling figure out the best way to address our emotions.</p>\n\n<p>During these times, this principle is here to remind you:</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s totally fine. There&rsquo;s no reason to react. I fully accept what I&rsquo;m feeling as merely a by-product of misunderstanding, and there&rsquo;s nothing necessarily wrong with these negative feelings.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>In contrast, my previous self would usually try to fight back.</p>\n\n<p>I would fail to recognise my struggle as a misunderstanding, and instead I would assume it was because I wasn&rsquo;t trying hard enough, or because my emotions were becoming unmanagable.</p>\n\n<p>Which would obviously make everything worse, eventually leading to relapse in some form.</p>\n\n<p>When I struggle with my feelings and emotions now, I actually feel rather calm on some level.</p>\n\n<p>I embrace and recognise those emotions as something not to take personally and I relax into them.</p>\n\n<p>I don&rsquo;t take them personally, and I thank them for explaining to me that I&rsquo;m personally doing something incorrect which is causing me to feel this way.</p>\n\n<p>After all, it&rsquo;s really hard to take something personally and react to it when you accept and acknowledge something for what it is.</p>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 3rem;\" class=\"five__principles__list__page\">\n  <span><div class=\"five__principles__item__page\">05 - Uncondition over judgement</div></span>\n</div>\n\n<p>This is the principle most porn addicts generally struggle with at first.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, being judgemental is not a problem specific to porn addiction itself, however it is certainly a strong contributor towards it.</p>\n\n<p>In a sense, this principle is sort of the opposite to Awareness over all.</p>\n\n<p>Because what judgements essentially do is take power away from your ability to be aware.</p>\n\n<p>And it&rsquo;s impossible to observe and be aware of what is taking place in our minds, if your minds are constantly focusing on creating new thoughts and incessantly describing reality.</p>\n\n<p>Certainly, I used to be a very judgemental person, often in ways that I didn&rsquo;t recognise as even being judgements.</p>\n\n<p>For example, I used to incessantly scan women in public, trying to find attractive ones to obsess over.</p>\n\n<p>Overtime I&rsquo;ve learnt not to judge at all, simply because I realise is serves no purpose in regards to cultivating my mental health.</p>\n\n<p>Largely through meditation.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Well, I hope that&rsquo;s helped you gain a better understanding of The Five Fundamental Principles of NeverFap and how they apply to my own life.</p>\n\n<p>If you&rsquo;d like to learn more, I&rsquo;d recommend going over my article <a class=\"link\" href=\"/articles/the-five-fundamental-principles-of-neverfap\">The Five Fundamental Principles of NeverFap</a> which does into more details from a theoretical perspective.</p>\n","date":"2019-01-07","draft":false,"slug":"the-five-principles-of-neverfap-as-they-relate-to-my-life","categories":["introduction"],"tags":["context","popular","neverfap basics","nofap schedule","porn addiction","addiction","awareness","nofap","neverfap","neverfap deluxe","neverfap deluxe guide","neverfap basics"],"permalink":"https://neverfapdeluxe.com/content_articles/the-five-principles-of-neverfap-as-they-relate-to-my-life/","tldr1":"The Five Fundamental Principles of NeverFap have been devised from my own personal approach towards addressing porn addiction.","tldr2":"","tldr3":"","tldr4":"","tldr5":"","section":"content_articles"},{"title":"Everything Is A Choice","page_id":"9a45b28b-bd20-4268-8885-4dc59e5bca5f","description":"Understanding how to exercise this choice is an important part of overcoming porn addiction.","content":"<!-- Very Happy With Edit -->\n\n<p>I want to talk about choice.</p>\n\n<p>Specifically, how it relates to the Five Fundamental Principles of NeverFap.</p>\n\n<p>The first principle that I almost always introduce to people is <u>Choice over mind</u>, because it is the one principle that most porn addicts (usually) find the most profound.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>Choice over mind relates to this idea that we have full control over how we react in life.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s an important concept to understand, because once you fully embrace the power of choice in life, you can learn to overcome life&rsquo;s most difficult challenges.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, assuming you put in the required practice.</p>\n\n<p>In this article I want to help you better understand where you may be misunderstanding this idea of choice.</p>\n\n<p>Because if you truly understood the power you currently have to change as an individual, you most likely wouldn&rsquo;t be on this website.</p>\n\n<p>So let&rsquo;s consider this your formal re-education.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr2\"/>\n\n<h2>What is choice?</h2>\n\n<hr class=\"hr2__bottom\"/>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>It begs to state that everything in life is a choice.</p>\n\n<p>There&rsquo;s choice in how we feel. Choice in what we want to think. Choice in how we live, and what we want to eat.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, there&rsquo;s choice in almost everything that happens in life.</p>\n\n<p>And yet, this doesn&rsquo;t mean that we necessarily get to choose all these things.</p>\n\n<p>We don&rsquo;t get to choose our race. We don&rsquo;t get to choose how others live their lives. Hell, we certainly don&rsquo;t get to choose what the weather will be that day.</p>\n\n<p>And that&rsquo;s okay.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>Because I'm here to tell you that none of this matters.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>Here&rsquo;s the thing.</p>\n\n<p>You do have one choice which is so powerful that it effectively overrides every other choice in your life.</p>\n\n<p>In part, because it is the only choice you truly have control over.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr2\"/>\n\n<h2>You get to choose how you want to respond.</h2>\n\n<hr class=\"hr2__bottom\"/>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>And it&rsquo;s a choice which overrides every other choice imaginable.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re already aware of this fact. I mean, obviously you have the ability to react to life&rsquo;s circumstances.</p>\n\n<p>Yet perhaps you don&rsquo;t quite understand the significance of what this actually means.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps you&rsquo;re misinterpretating what having this choice allows you to do, so let&rsquo;s explore that idea.</p>\n\n<p>When you truly understand what <u>Choice over mind</u> means, it completely changes the way you look at things.</p>\n\n<p>You no longer become victim, or rather you realise that you never were victim, over that which you cannot choose.</p>\n\n<p>So what does it being able to respond actually mean?</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>Put simply, your ability to respond is the most powerful choice you have, because it is the only choice you as an individual can actually make.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>At no point do you have absolute certainty over any outcome in life.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, what you do have is absolute certainty over your actions, and this is quite profound for a few reasons.</p>\n\n<p>If your ability to respond is the only true choice that you have, then it signifies that you have full control over your life.</p>\n\n<p>Because response happens through actions, and actions are the only means through which we can change as human beings.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr4\"/>\n\n<h4>Which really is to say that you have full control over who you want to become.</h4>\n\n<hr class=\"hr4__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>In addition, it also signifies that we are all equal in terms of our ability to take action.</p>\n\n<p>Which is to say that we all have that exact same opportunity to become, because we all have the same ability to take action.</p>\n\n<p>From this point of view, everything we are today can be viewed as a sum of our actions.</p>\n\n<p>From a potential point of view, we really are no different.</p>\n\n<p>We both have the exact same potential to respond on a low level with our thoughts and emotions.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>The only difference between you and me is in the actions that we've taken over time.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>Which is to say that if you responded in the same way that I did, then you also would not be a porn addict.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr2\"/>\n\n<h2>Success and your actions</h2>\n\n<hr class=\"hr2__bottom\"/>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The important thing to understand about success is that it doesn&rsquo;t happen at a high level.</p>\n\n<p>It happens on an emotional and physical level.</p>\n\n<p>Success is the difference between choosing to remain calm in a tense situation, as opposed to losing our cool.</p>\n\n<p>Success isn&rsquo;t about being wealthy or driving a fast car.</p>\n\n<p>Success is about having control over our feelings and emotions, so we feel indifferent about how much money we or anyone else has.</p>\n\n<p>In the context of porn addiction, success is acknowledging that our cravings for porn are merely habitual, and not to be taken personally.</p>\n\n<p>Success is meditating daily so that we can learn the skills to properly address our porn addiction.</p>\n\n<p>Remember.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr4\"/>\n\n<h4>The only difference between someone who has successfully overcome porn addiction and someone who continually fails, is that the person who overcame porn addiction took the right actions to get there.</h4>\n\n<hr class=\"hr4__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>Porn addicts really are no different from each other.</p>\n\n<p>Every porn addict goes through the same feelings and emotions of helplessness, guilt and depression.</p>\n\n<p>The only difference is in how they choose to respond to these feelings and emotions, so they don&rsquo;t let them dominate their life.</p>\n\n<p>Now, I&rsquo;m not suggesting that you&rsquo;ll be able to face these feelings and emotions by merely being aware of them.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>However, what I am suggesting is that with the right guidance and practice, you can develop the ability to be able to.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>Moving forward, I recommend checking out our list of <a class=\"link\" href=\"\">NeverFap Deluxe

They don&rsquo;t understand their emotions.</p>\n\n<p>They don&rsquo;t know how to maintain control over their minds, and yet they wonder why they struggle.</p>\n\n<p>This is precisely the reason why meditation is important, because it provides us with the ability to face these challenges without hesitation or fear.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>When you have control over your emotions, it makes situations where you don't necessarily feel in control manageable.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>Yes.</p>\n\n<p>Manageable.</p>\n\n<p>Because successfully overcoming porn addiction is largely about learning to navigate through your emotions, and manage them so that you can be in control of your desired outcomes.</p>\n\n<p>And you can&rsquo;t manage your emotions if you don&rsquo;t have mastery over your mind, along with your ability to produce and regulate them.</p>\n\n<p>So what exactly are some of the skills and practices of meditation?</p>\n\n<p>For starters, there&rsquo;s observation.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr2\"/>\n\n<h2>Observation is perhaps the most fundamental skill you can learn in regards to developing your awareness.</h2>\n\n<hr class=\"hr2__bottom\"/>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>It is the skill we will focus on and develop most throughout the practices here on NeverFap Deluxe.</p>\n\n<!-- TODO: If you'd like to find out more, you can read more about it in my article the power of observation -->\n\n<p>In part, because it&rsquo;s really hard to take something personally or lose our frame of reference when we&rsquo;re merely observing reality.</p>\n\n<p>As opposed to being invested in it with our own personal beliefs, thoughts and judgements</p>\n\n<p>Aside from observation, there is also introspection (our ability to look into ourselves), perspective (changing the way we think about things), as well as a whole range of different skills.</p>\n\n<p>These skills are broken into Five Fundamental Principles which allow us to focus on particular outcomes related to overcoming porn addiction.</p>\n\n<p>I recommend checking out our list of <a class=\"link\" href=\"\">NeverFap Deluxe Practices</a> for a list of exercises you can do to develop awareness in your life.</p>\n","date":"2018-12-12","draft":false,"slug":"the-importance-of-meditation-for-porn-addiction","categories":["awareness-over-all"],"tags":["context","meditation","porn addiction","addiction","awareness","awareness exercises","perspective","nofap","neverfap","neverfap deluxe"],"permalink":"https://neverfapdeluxe.com/content_articles/the-importance-of-meditation-for-porn-addiction/","tldr1":"Meditation is the single most important thing you can do for your porn recovery.","tldr2":"Meditation teaches you to regain control over your thoughts and emotions.","tldr3":"Observation is the most fundamental skill in terms of effective meditation.","tldr4":"","tldr5":"","section":"content_articles"},{"title":"Paying The NeverFap Maintenance Tax","page_id":"efccd43e-ebf2-491b-84e6-faa0cd37a273","description":"When we treat the maintainance of our mental health as an unnecessary burden, we compromise our ability to exert control over our thoughts and emotions.","content":"<!-- Very Happy With Edit -->\n\n<p>What exactly is the NeverFap Maintenance Tax?</p>\n\n<p>Well, aside from the fact that it&rsquo;s a term I&rsquo;ve more-or-less made up on the spot, the NeverFap Maintenance Tax refers to the time and effort required in order to maintain our physical and mental health.</p>\n\n<p>It includes things like meditation, exercising, relaxing, studying, meditating, eating and brushing our teeth.</p>\n\n<p>Everything that helps us keep regular.</p>\n\n<p>The reason why I call it a tax is because many of us have the attitude that maintaining these things is simply unnecessary.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, most of us can tend to view these things as a burden (usually due to the amount of time associated with actually doing them), despite the positive benefits they provide.</p>\n\n<p>So what ends ups happening is that become selective about what we view as necessary or not.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe we don’t exercise, because we’d rather be studying or playing video games. Maybe we work or study too hard, because we don’t see the value in meditating or relaxing.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>In doing this, we make significant compromises to our ability to function.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>And what’s really disturbing, is how utterly unaware we are of how much we compromise in terms of our ability to function, often without truly being aware of it.</p>\n\n<p>Certainly, I’ve been there.</p>\n\n<p>And only now in retrospect do I realise how I was making something like giving up porn addiction almost impossible due to my own negative attitudes towards self-care.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr2\"/>\n\n<h2>In other words, if you’re struggling with your porn addiction it may be because you’re not paying your maintenance tax in full.</h2>\n\n<hr class=\"hr2__bottom\"/>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>In order to demonstrate this, I’m first going to talk about where I personally was making those compromises in my life.</p>\n\n<p>And then explain the effect it was having on my ability to cope.</p>\n\n<p>As well as what successfully paying the maintenance tax actually entails.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>Facing the consequences of imbalance</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>Prior to this realisation, I was under the impression that I was relatively functional and healthy.</p>\n\n<p>I was exercising three times a week. I was eating healthily. I was in a fantastic relationship. I was incredibly passionate about studying and I was full of ambition, ready to take on the world.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, there were other aspects of my life that were severely imbalanced.</p>\n\n<p>Aside from being severely addicted to porn, I was beginning to suffer from anxiety attacks from my excessive studying.</p>\n\n<p>I was studying so much that it used to induce these kinds of &lsquo;coding nightmares&rsquo; where I would be mentally coding in my sleep, but stuck in an indefinite loop where I would just write the same code again and again and again.</p>\n\n<p>It was truly awful.</p>\n\n<p>My problem was that I was pushing myself too hard and I didn’t provide myself with the opportunity to relax.</p>\n\n<p>All because I didn&rsquo;t view relaxation as a form of maintenance, in part because I was so obsessed with being productive and not falling behind.</p>\n\n<p>Once I&rsquo;d respected this balance however (primarily by not overworking myself to death) I was able function more clearly.</p>\n\n<p>And most importantly, regain control over my emotions so that my cravings for porn could become a thing of the past.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, you may have an opposite problem. You may not be motivated enough.</p>\n\n<p>Everyone is different in this regard, and this website is designed to help you figure out exactly where your weaknesses are.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr2\"/>\n\n<h2>Change in attitude</h2>\n\n<hr class=\"hr2__bottom\"/>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Embracing self-care requires a change in attitude.</p>\n\n<p>Instead of thinking about our immediate wants, we need to begin thinking holistically and understand that cutting corners of any kind is going to result in future pain.</p>\n\n<p>Certainly, costing us time and emotional stability in the long run.</p>\n\n<p>Which exponentially increases the difficulty of everything else we hope to achieve, regardless of how much time we spend on those pursuits themselves.</p>\n\n<p>Only by paying the maintanence tax can we ensure a) Our mental health remains intact and b) We achieve all our ambitions equally.</p>\n\n<p>And that really is the key point people completely miss:</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>By respecting balance in our life, we can have everything we want without the compromise.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>It simply requires respecting long-term outcomes, as opposed to hesitant, short-term outcomes.</p>\n\n<p>The key takeaway from this article is that self-care exists above all, especially if you care about productivity.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, that self-care is not optional.</p>\n\n<p>It is a hard requirement and by avoiding self-care, we delay so many positive aspects of our life.</p>\n\n<!-- Talk about NeverFap Schedule article. -->\n","date":"2018-12-02","draft":false,"slug":"paying-the-neverfap-maintenance-tax","categories":["balance-over-reward"],"tags":["context","porn addiction","addiction","awareness","nofap","neverfap","neverfap deluxe"],"permalink":"https://neverfapdeluxe.com/content_articles/paying-the-neverfap-maintenance-tax/","tldr1":"Maintenance of our mental and physical health is a hard requirement.","tldr2":"Compromising on this maintenance significantly affects our ability to function.","tldr3":"Respecting balance allows us to have everything we want without compromise.","tldr4":"","tldr5":"","section":"content_articles"},{"title":"What Makes NeverFap So Different","page_id":"24edc96e-d77c-480a-ba19-ef40c009e6a1","description":"NeverFap is a comprehensive porn addiction recovery platform that is designed to make overcoming your porn addiction as simple as possible.","content":"<!-- Very Happy With Edit -->\n\n<p>NeverFap Deluxe aims to be a comprehensive solution towards addressing your porn addiction.</p>\n\n<p>While there are many resources out there on the internet which accurately describe what porn addiction is and how it functions.</p>\n\n<p>I couldn&rsquo;t find a single resource that could accurately tell me <u>exactly what I needed to do</u> in order stop being a porn addict.</p>\n\n<p>Which is a bit like saying: &ldquo;Hey buddy, you have a severe problem, but I won&rsquo;t actually tell you how to address it&rdquo;.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;However what I&rsquo;ll do instead is make you increasingly aware of it, so that you feel compelled to do something about it, even though I can&rsquo;t actually help you to change.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Which really is of no help to you, regardless of how useful their information is at describing what your problems are.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, there were two kinds of resources that I frequently came across:</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hrul\"/>\n\n<p><strong>Incomplete advice from existing porn addicts, usually in the form of forum posts.

all the time.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>It’s called rumination.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>And I personally consider it a form of self-harm.</p>\n\n<p>Rumination is when you continually spur over your thoughts, without actually pursuing any hard actions as a result.</p>\n\n<p>Understandably, it is an instinctive human response to ask why.</p>\n\n<p>But when we do it excessively, it serves no purpose and it becomes a literal bottleneck in terms of affecting our ability to process and produce information.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>Which is to say that asking why is great for creating an initial assessment, however beyond that it becomes nothing more than a harmful burden.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>If we look at something like learning to play basketball, it&rsquo;s clear there are a number of key skills we must learn.</p>\n\n<p>For example, there&rsquo;s dribbling, shooting, blocking and learning to run with the ball.</p>\n\n<p>It doesn’t matter if you don&rsquo;t understand what materials a basketball is made of, nor even who invented basketball.</p>\n\n<p>Regardless of what your understanding of the sentiment behind basketball, those are the core skills you are going to have to learn.</p>\n\n<!-- Which is to say that while dribbling is important, practicing dribbling  -->\n\n<!-- \n\n is something which may help you better understand those skills, however the core skills themselves are undeniable.\n\n -->\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>Another way of putting it is that we must focus on the how, rather than the why.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>If it helps you can think of the understanding is the &lsquo;why&rsquo;, while the core skills are the &lsquo;how&rsquo;.</p>\n\n<p>When we focus on how to achieve something, we no longer become concerned with trying to define our circumstances using pre-existing knowledge.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, we become actively focused on actions which will help us change our reality for the better.</p>\n\n<p>Questions such as:</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hrul\"/>\n\n<p><strong>&ldquo;How am I a porn addict?&rdquo;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>&ldquo;What do I on a daily basis which makes me a porn addict?&rdquo;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>&ldquo;What do I have to do in order to avoid porn addiction?&rdquo;</strong></p>\n\n<hr class=\"hrul__bottom\"/>\n\n<p>From reasons to tangible processes, you also completely change the way you think about your own problems.</p>\n\n<p>No longer do they become about building narratives or perceptions of who you are. Instead, they become about the mechanical details of what makes you a porn addict.</p>\n\n<p>Because at the end of the day, addiction is a process.</p>\n\n<p>It is something you actively engage in and contribute towards, whether you quite realise it or not.</p>\n\n<p>And although attempting to understand why you may be engaged in this process may seem useful, it is also a really indirect way of trying to influence how it functions.</p>\n\n<p>To be a little bit more precise, here are a list of the whys which you shouldn&rsquo;t concern yourself with:</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hrul\"/>\n\n<p><strong>&ldquo;Why am I a porn addict?&rdquo;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>&ldquo;Why do I find overcoming porn addiction so difficult?&rdquo;</strong></p>\n\n<hr class=\"hrul__bottom\"/>\n\n<p>These are all meaningless questions.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, these are the types of questions we need to be thinking about:</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hrul\"/>\n\n<p><strong>&ldquo;What can I do to influence my porn addiction?&rdquo;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>&ldquo;What are the steps leading up to when I watch porn?&rdquo;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>&ldquo;How do I think about women?&rdquo;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>&ldquo;How do I fall into the trap of believing that it’s okay to watch porn?&rdquo;</strong></p>\n\n<hr class=\"hrul__bottom\"/>\n\n<p>Aside from the rest of the introductory articles on this website, I highly recommend taking a look at some of the practices on offer, so you can begin to make actual changes to your life today.</p>\n\n<p>Hopefully this article clarifies the change of thinking that needs to take place, in order for us to overcome our porn addiction.</p>\n","date":"2018-11-13","draft":false,"slug":"why-am-i-a-porn-addict","categories":["introduction"],"tags":["context","porn recovery","neverfap basics","porn addiction","addiction","awareness","nofap","neverfap","neverfap deluxe","neverfap basics","NoFap Companion"],"permalink":"https://neverfapdeluxe.com/content_articles/why-am-i-a-porn-addict/","tldr1":"Asking why we are has little to do with actually changing who we are.","tldr2":"Over asking why is a process called rumination, and it is a form of self-harm","tldr3":"Actions are responsible for helping us change.

It is something which remains true irrespective of whether you agree with it, how you feel about it, nor even how you understand or interpret it.</p>\n\n<p>It simply is.</p>\n\n<p>You may attempt to dispute these fundamental truths or argue against their validity, which is perfectly fine if that is your intention.</p>\n\n<p>However it certainly won&rsquo;t help you overcome porn addiction, which is the primary reason why you&rsquo;re here. You know, to receive help for a problem that you cannot do alone.</p>\n\n<p>My intention on the other hand is very clear. I am here to help you overcome porn addiction.</p>\n\n<p>So in order to do this, we must first set some ground rules and truly understand exactly what we&rsquo;re getting ourselves into.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr2\"/>\n\n<h2>Ground rules</h2>\n\n<hr class=\"hr2__bottom\"/>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The key thing to understand about fundamental principles is that they are not subject to open-ended thinking.</p>\n\n<p>For example:</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hrul\"/>\n\n<p><strong>&ldquo;Well, my mind doesn&rsquo;t really work like that.&rdquo;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>&ldquo;While that may be true, I don&rsquo;t personally allow it to affect me in that way.&rdquo;</strong></p>\n\n<hr class=\"hrul__bottom\"/>\n\n<p>This is not how fundamental principles operate.</p>\n\n<p>Hard truths are not open to subjective questioning. Certainly, you&rsquo;re more than welcome to question them if you like, however it won&rsquo;t help you with your porn addiction.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, there&rsquo;s a very specific word that is used to describe when people refuse to accept the fundamental basis of reality.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>It's called denial.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>Whether you realise it or not, the reason why you are a porn addict is because you are in denial about some aspect of your life.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps it is a misunderstanding of what you are capable of as a human being. Perhaps you have a low opinion of your self-worth. Maybe you never had the chance to develop any healthy coping mechanisms growing up.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, the aim of these five fundamental principles is to help you expose the fact that there is something wrong with the way you currently think.</p>\n\n<p>As a former porn addict, I encourage you to embrace the idea that everything you know about yourself is wrong, and to not fight the unfamiliar.</p>\n\n<p>You cannot get better if you cannot first recognise that you have a problem.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr2\"/>\n\n<h2>The Five Fundamental Principles of NeverFap</h2>\n\n<hr class=\"hr2__bottom\"/>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>On a superficial level, none of these principles seem to have anything to do with addressing porn addiction.</p>\n\n<p>For example, there is no fundamental principle along the lines of &ldquo;Never visit a porn website ever again&rdquo; or &ldquo;You should never willingly orgasm&rdquo;.</p>\n\n<p>A large part of the reason why this is the case is because porn addiction has very little to do with porn itself.</p>\n\n<p>Rather, porn addiction is merely a symptom of a wider range of problems which NeverFap aims to address.</p>\n\n<p>So without further ado, here are the five fundmental principles of NeverFap:</p>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 3rem;\" class=\"five__principles__list__page\">\n  <span><div class=\"five__principles__item__page\">01 - Choice over mind</div></span>\n</div>\n\n<p>While all these principles are important in their own right, this is perhaps the one that people tend to struggle with most.</p>\n\n<p>Or rather, it is a way of thinking and understanding which is completely foreign to most of us, and even those of us who do not have a porn addiction.</p>\n\n<p>What <strong>Choice over mind</strong> iterates is the fact that you have complete control over your mind.</p>\n\n<p>This is irrespective of whether you currently feel in control of your mind, whether you agree it&rsquo;s possible to have full control over your mind, or whether you&rsquo;ve even experienced having full control over your mind.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>What's important to understand is that your mind is fundamentally capable of being controlled.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>I would personally say that this fundamental principle is both equal parts understanding and practice.</p>\n\n<p>Certainly while practicing and exercising choice is important, understanding the extent to which we have choice will help us gain the confidence to truly feel comfortable dictating our thoughts, feelings, emotions and behaviour.</p>\n\n<p>By in large, the way this confidence is achieved is through controlled meditation and perspective training, which is covered extensively throughout the <a class=\"link\" href=\"/practices\">NeverFap Deluxe Practices</a> section.</p>\n\n<p>For example, a situation where many porn addicts believe they do not have control is in public.</p>\n\n<p>Many porn addicts (particularly male porn addicts) have a tendency to stare at women they find attractive in public. In particular, control over staring at hot women in public.</p>\n\n<p>Well, I&rsquo;m here to tell you that with daily practice, we can learn to develop control over our mind, and completely filter the women we walk past in public altogether.</p>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 3rem;\" class=\"five__principles__list__page\">\n  <span><div class=\"five__principles__item__page\">02 - Balance over reward</div></span>\n</div>\n\n<p>This is one of those concepts that people think they understand, and yet refutely misunderstand simply because of how obliviously unbalanced they are to begin with.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s something most people outright ignore because they don&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s &ldquo;that big of a deal&rdquo;, not quite understanding the consequences that ignoring balance can have on their life.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, denial.</p>\n\n<p>What <strong>Balance over reward</strong> maintains is this idea that we must prioritise balance over our immediate wants and goals.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>Often we become so affixated with something, either through obsession or neglect, we fail to consider the wider ramifications of our actions.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>So we cut corners in order to achieve or experience what we want, only to face the consequences of our actions later.</p>\n\n<p>Not realising that the reason why we&rsquo;re struggling is because of the corners that we&rsquo;ve cut.</p>\n\n<p>For example, overworking ourselves is a prominent example of cutting corners in order to achieve something at the immediate harm to both our physical and mental health.</p>\n\n<p>We stay up late to finish what we&rsquo;re working on, ruining our sleep schedule and ability to regulate stress. We most cases, resort to caffeine and porn to keep us energised, resulting in addiction and dysfunction.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>And yet, we're so focused on the outcome that we don't quite realise what we're even doing wrong.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>Rather, we feel justified in our actions, inspite of the fact that we recognise that we may have a problem with addiction or our mental health.</p>\n\n<p>Even though a) Cutting corners makes you less productive overall than if you were functioning normally and b) Having the added effect of ruining your mental health physical health in the process.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, by learning to respect the principle of balance in your life, you can actually get more done overall without burning out, and without the constant baggage of emotional volatility and stress.</p>\n\n<p>I think part of the problem is that people fall into the trap of believing they&rsquo;re inherently unique when it comes to cutting corners.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>They think they can somehow \"cheat\" the system and come out ahead.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>Put simply, it&rsquo;s impossible.</p>\n\n<p>No one is immune to their own biology.</p>\n\n<p>Even though people may not show it (in most cases, they simply know how to hide it very effectively), there is a hard limit to what everyone can do on a daily basis without it affecting their mental health.</p>\n\n<p>The point is that if we are to overcome our porn addiction, we must respect this limit and embrace balance in everything we do.</p>\n\n<p>This means taking breaks, even when we want to push forward. This means challenging ourselves, even if we don&rsquo;t feel like it.</p>\n\n<p>And by learning to value and respect these boundaries, you may gain a significant amount of control over your life.</p>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 3rem;\" class=\"five__principles__list__page\">\n  <span><div class=\"five__principles__item__page\">03 - Awareness over all</div></span>\n</div>\n\n<p>Awareness is absolutely fundamental to everything we do.</p>\n\n<p>It is what allows us to identify and address the destructive patterns in our life, as well as serve as a stop-gap between our thoughts and our actions.</p>\n\n<p>What <strong>Awareness over all</strong> maintains is that having awareness over our actions is critical to not only understanding the impact those actions may have over our own lives, but also how we can learn to gain control over them.</p>\n\n<p>Without full awareness, we simply cannot hope to act with any amount of intention, nor understand the responsibility we have over them.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>Instead, we allow our habitual thoughts, emotions and beliefs to take over and continue their self-destructive patterns.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>I think the reason why most people struggle with this concept of awareness is because:</p>\n\n<p>a) They&rsquo;re not currently aware, nor understand how to be aware because it&rsquo;s not something they&rsquo;ve ever practiced.</p>\n\n<p>b) Most people struggle to even understand what this concept of awareness actually is. (I was certainly one of them)</p>\n\n<p>In reality, awareness is actually really simple.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>Awareness is your ability to sense the world around you.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>That&rsquo;s literally it.</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s not about focusing your mind or trying really hard not to think, or even trying to figure out how to empty the thoughts in your mind.</p>\n\n<p>Certainly, they may be useful skills and they may be a consequence of practicing awareness, however the actual action of awareness itself is simple.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>It is simply being present with your senses.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>Pretty neat, huh?</p>\n\n<p>And when you&rsquo;re present with your senses and what you&rsquo;re feeling, it provides you with the ability to control and gauge your experience.</p>\n\n<p>Witout reaction, and without taking what you&rsquo;re experiencing it personally.</p>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 3rem;\" class=\"five__principles__list__page\">\n  <span><div class=\"five__principles__item__page\">04 - Struggle over none</div></span>\n</div>\n\n<p>Essentially, the basis of this principle is that the simplest path is often the most efficient.</p>\n\n<p>And as humans, we instinctly do what we find most simple, either for better or worse.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>Therefore, solutions which are simple by design are going to be more effective than solutions which are convoluted.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s the reason why I personally follow the paleo diet and only eat one meal a day.</p>\n\n<p>Doing this is vastly more simple than counting calories, obsessing over when I can eat and organising three meals a day.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, simple is often easy.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>Certainly, part of the reason why we're addicted to porn in the first place is because it's the easy thing to do.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>Back to the principle itself, what <u><strong>Struggle over none</strong></u> relates to is this idea that if you&rsquo;re really struggling with someone, then you&rsquo;re probably not doing it right.</p>\n\n<p>Which means either you&rsquo;re not understanding it intuitively, or you&rsquo;re fundamentally misunderstanding what you&rsquo;re trying to understand.</p>\n\n<p>For example, understanding that porn recovery isn&rsquo;t about fighting yourself or forcing yourself to &ldquo;get through it&rdquo;.</p>\n\n<p>If at any point you feel like you have to force yourself to do something, then it indicates that you&rsquo;re doing something incorrectly or more importantly, not actually recovering from porn addiction.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>Because life without porn isn't a struggle.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s actually one of the most liberating and empowering things you can do.</p>\n\n<p>The takeaway being that life only ever becomes a chore when we act against it or neglect it.</p>\n\n<p>Especially when it comes to addressing porn addiction.</p>\n\n<div style=\"margin-top: 3rem;\" class=\"five__principles__list__page\">\n  <span><div class=\"five__principles__item__page\">05 - Uncondition over judgement</div></span>\n</div>\n\n<p>Much like Balance over reward, this is one of those principles that people tend to ignore, because they underestimate the ramifications of ignoring it.</p>\n\n<p><u>Uncondition over judgement</u> is about pursing acceptance over judgement.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>What a lot of people don't realise is that judgement is a mental trap.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>Because when you make a judgement, you essentially trap yourself into a limited point of view.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, the reason why it may not seem like a mental trap is because at first, making one judgement isn&rsquo;t going to kill you.</p>\n\n<p>But humans never just make one judgement.</p>\n\n<p>We make thousands of judgements each and everyday, each time moulding our perception of who we are and what we know.</p>\n\n<p>And when we make enough of these judgements, they can form into habits of belief which prevent us from exercising awareness.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>After all, how can you be aware of what's going on in your mind, if your mind is in a constant state of habitual thinking?</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>The more judgements you make, the more awareness you trade, and the more faith that gets placed into ideas of who you are and what the world is.</p>\n\n<p>It becomes a trap because without realising it, through judgement you end up in a state of habitual unawareness, full of harmful behaviours that we have no idea how to control or influence.</p>\n\n<p>Now imagine trying to address something like porn addiction under this state of mind.</p>\n\n<p>It becomes almost impossible.</p>\n\n<p>Because guess what happens when you invest all your faith into a bunch of fruitless ideas?</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>You end up having no capacity to address the problems in your life which actually has meaning, like your porn addiction.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>Remember, there are consequences to everything you do in life, whether you realise it or not.</p>\n\n<p>So there you go.</p>\n\n<p>The Five Fundamental Principles of NeverFap.</p>\n\n<p>Hopefully you have a better idea of what the Five Fundamental Principles of NeverFap are, as well as what they represent.</p>\n\n<p>They exist to help guide you through your porn recovery journey, as well as help you make healthy decisions.</p>\n\n<p>If ever you get confused about anything, it can help to come back to these five principles, or try to assess what you might be doing incorrectly.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>Because at the end of the day, overcoming porn addiction is completely within your reach.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>You just have to know exactly what you&rsquo;re doing and why.</p>\n\n<p>Moving forward I recommend checking out the article index which contains further information in regards to the NeverFap method of overcoming porn addiction.</p>\n","date":"2018-10-29","draft":false,"slug":"the-five-fundamental-principles-of-neverfap","categories":["introduction"],"tags":["context","popular","porn recovery","neverfap basics","porn addiction","addiction","awareness","nofap","neverfap","neverfap deluxe","neverfap basics"],"permalink":"https://neverfapdeluxe.com/content_articles/the-five-fundamental-principles-of-neverfap/","tldr1":"Fundamental principles are hard truths, irrespective of how you think about them.","tldr2":"These principles have little to do with porn, because porn recovery has nothing to do with porn.","tldr3":"There are Five Fundamental Principles of NeverFap.","tldr4":"","tldr5":"","section":"content_articles"},{"title":"My Personal Porn Recovery Journey","page_id":"eca0234f-b8cb-468a-90af-c5623fc99aab","description":"This article explains my journey with porn addiction, along with some of the realisations I had along the way.","content":"<!-- Very Happy with edit -->\n\n<p>I came across porn at a very young age.</p>\n\n<p>I started watching porn from the very moment I figured out how to physically masturbate at the age of 10.</p>\n\n<p>And I&rsquo;m sure your story is quite similar.</p>\n\n<p>Discovering porn as a kid is like discovering Bitcoin as a young adult.</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s this absurd hyper-fantasy that sucks you in and I really don&rsquo;t need to go into the details. I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re more than familiar with what it means to be someone who watches porn on a regular basis.</p>\n\n<p>It sucks.</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;m not exactly sure when I decided that I wanted to give up porn, but I suppose there have been a variety of serious attempts through out my life.</p>\n\n<p>My very first attempt at giving up porn began at age 16, where I thought I&rsquo;d try to give up porn for the hell of it.</p>\n\n<p>You know, because you&rsquo;re only ever 16 once, and I wanted to experience what 16 year old me could achieve.</p>\n\n<p>Overall I managed to abstain for approximately 3 weeks, until collapsing into a puddle of sweat and binge-mania.</p>\n\n<p>It then wasn&rsquo;t until I was around 20 years old that I began to recognise that porn was an actual problem in my life, if not from the simple perspective of being an addict.</p>\n\n<p>A problem which I was determined to understand and overcome.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>Age 25. October 20th 2018.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>The last time in my entire life that I will have ever masturbated to, or ever watched porn.</p>\n\n<p>A commitment that I have upheld until today, rather effortlessly.</p>\n\n<p>You know when you have that moment when everything clicks, and absolutely everything comes together and makes sense?</p>\n\n<p>I was the guy who had that moment, and I&rsquo;ve been in control of myself ever since.</p>\n\n<p>If I had to detail all the changes that occurred within that five year period, we&rsquo;d literally be here all day.</p>\n\n<p>Because, you know.</p>\n\n<p>A lot changes over the five year span of anyone&rsquo;s life, and the best we can do is look back in retrospect and identify the things that went right.</p>\n\n<p>So up until then, here&rsquo;s what I was doing right:</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hrul\"/>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Done the whole Paleo diet thing</li>\n<li>Studied various books and perspective course on mental health</li>\n<li>Took cold showers everyday before bed</li>\n<li>Ate only one meal a day (via intermittent fasting)</li>\n<li>Was doing Leangains and lifting weights three times a week</li>\n<li>Was in an amazing, supportive relationship</li>\n<li>Worked obscenely hard to get a job as a programmer</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr class=\"hrul__bottom\"/>\n\n<p>Truth was, I was doing almost everything right.</p>\n\n<p>Yet none of that actually mattered, because it was those small things that I wasn&rsquo;t doing, which made the other 90% of my effort null.</p>\n\n<p>Today I want to share what those things are with you are, and why they were arguably more important than anything I&rsquo;d done up until then.</p>\n\n<p>I suppose there were two main things that happened, which helped me better understand exactly what I had to do to address my porn addiction.</p>\n\n<p>And it all happened within the space of a few weeks.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>For starters I had a breakdown.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>You see, I suffer from a condition from Bipolar Disorder, and it was something I hadn&rsquo;t told my partner about.</p>\n\n<p>In part, because I just assumed she already knew, but primarily because I&rsquo;m not the kind of person who will ask for help from others.</p>\n\n<p>However, one day I was feeling particularly vulnerable and I realised one very important thing, which I maintain is important to this day:</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>It's impossible to do it alone.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>The reason why you break down is because for most people, it&rsquo;s almost impossible to admit that you have a problem, and so mentally you just turn to jelly.</p>\n\n<p>At first, she didn&rsquo;t take it seriously.</p>\n\n<p>Because I&rsquo;d never mentioned it once in our 4 year relationship. But when it kicked in that it was actually something I was hiding from her this whole time, it made a lot of sense.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, a few things happened as a result.</p>\n\n<p>Now that she was aware of my disorder, I was now able to be honest about all the things I was hiding from her. In particular, my porn addiction which was in part a coping mechanism for my Bipolar.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>Which as a result, gave me this surreal confidence to actually address my porn addiction.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>For whatever reason, when you get everything off your chest, it just completely changes everything.</p>\n\n<p>You no longer feel guilt for who you are and you no longer see yourself as a monster.</p>\n\n<p>You merely see your actions as a symptom of something greater, which allows you to not take them personally, and not react to them negatively.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, it also meant that I could ask for help and support when required. I could tell her that I was struggling with my porn addiction, and not feel judged or vindicated.</p>\n\n<p>Understanding and recognising my disorder, which I&rsquo;d previously dismissed, helped me better understand my emotions and therefore, manage them a lot more easily.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>I finally felt free to just move on with my life.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>And it&rsquo;s impossible to understate what that feels like.</p>\n\n<p>The second thing which happened, which came about in large part due to my breakdown and coming out about my Bipolar, was equally if not more profound in terms of addressing my porn addiction.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>Essentially, I'd discovered this thing called meditation.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>The funny thing about meditation is that I&rsquo;d tried doing it through out various phases of my life to no avail.</p>\n\n<p>Or perhaps all that effort had accumulated up until then, I&rsquo;m not entirely sure.</p>\n\n<p>Regardless, up until then I&rsquo;d failed to see the value in the meditation.</p>\n\n<p>However following my break down, I&rsquo;d decided to take my mental health seriously, and I was determined to do everything in my power to get better.</p>\n\n<p>A friend at work had mentioned the benefits of meditation in his life, as well as a popular guided meditation course which he swore his life by.</p>\n\n<p>So I decided to do this course, which was basically a 10 minute commitment before bed each day, and my gosh.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>I can happily say that within two weeks of meditating I'd learnt more about how to manage my porn addiction than in absolutely everything I've done in the past five years to try and curb my addiction.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>All because of a simple 10 minute practice before bed.</p>\n\n<p>Absolutely incredible.</p>\n\n<p>The primary reason for this is because meditating allowed me to effectively control and manage my emotions</p>\n\n<p>Primarily, the practice of meditation provided me with the ability to fully control my mind, something which I hadn&rsquo;t experienced before.</p>\n\n<p>It allowed me to relax my mind at will. To prevent incessant thinking and most importantly, not take my emotions and what I was feeling personally.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>If I had one piece of advice to anyone wanting to seriously overcome their porn addiction, it would be to start meditating today.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>It is possibly the most essential thing you can do to assist you in overcoming porn addiction.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, what&rsquo;s also important is how you meditate, and that&rsquo;s precisely what I cover in this website.</p>\n\n<p>For example, a form of meditation I personally find incredibly useful is walking in public, and simply avoiding placing our attention on people walking past us.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr2\"/>\n\n<h2>The next steps in my journey</h2>\n\n<hr class=\"hr2__bottom\"/>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Now that I&rsquo;ve managed to successfully overcome porn addiction, I want to help you do the same.</p>\n\n<p>Often the best way to learn something is to teach others how to do that same thing, and so that&rsquo;s what I want to do with NeverFap.</p>\n\n<p>To create a vibrant resource for other porn addicts to learn from, so we no longer have to struggle and cause harm in life due to the effects of addiction.</p>\n\n<p>The information is all here.</p>\n\n<p><a class=\"link\" href=\"/guide\">Get started</a> today.</p>\n","date":"2018-10-22","draft":false,"slug":"my-personal-porn-recovery-journey","categories":["introduction"],"tags":["context","popular","porn recovery","neverfap basics","nofap schedule","porn addiction","addiction","awareness","nofap","neverfap","neverfap deluxe","neverfap basics"],"permalink":"https://neverfapdeluxe.com/content_articles/my-personal-porn-recovery-journey/","tldr1":"I last watched porn in October 20th 2018.","tldr2":"The first reason why I've managed to succeed is because I came out about my disorder to my partner.","tldr3":"The second reason why I've managed to succeed is because I began practicing meditation.","tldr4":"","tldr5":"","section":"content_articles"},{"title":"Introduction To The NeverFap Deluxe Guide","page_id":"dd420096-3aa1-4043-8bf5-47925ebdb82e","description":"The NeverFap Deluxe Guide is designed to help you overcome porn addiction through awareness, self-control and improved mental health.","content":"<!-- Very Happy with edit -->\n\n<p>Today I’m here to talk to you about porn addiction.</p>\n\n<p>Porn addiction itself can be a very complex topic. We can spend hours discussing the intricacies of how particular cultural upbringings affect the way we view women.</p>\n\n<p>We can bore over the details of our past trauma in order to extract why exactly we’re so obsessed with certain types of porn.</p>\n\n<p>We can do all sorts of things to try and understand why we humans are the way we are, and to be quite frank&hellip; it’s all very exhausting.</p>\n\n<p>Because the truth is, overcoming pornography addiction is deceptively simple.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>From a process point of view, I spend around 40 minutes each day practicing meditation.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>And that’s literally all I need to maintain control over my mind.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, I also do a lot more, like train my mind with perspective exercises, but now that I&rsquo;m in a stable state in regards to my porn addiction, all I really have do is maintain my mental health.</p>\n\n<p>I now no longer think about porn. No longer do I crave porn. I wouldn’t even want to masturbate to porn if you put it in front of me.</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s just not how my mind works anymore.</p>\n\n<p>And it&rsquo;s so empowering.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>The point is that overcoming porn addiction is totally achievable.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>And I want to show you how.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, we have one rule here at NeverFap:</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>Practice. Practice. Practice.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>Without practicing the core skills that will help you overcome porn addiction, you simply cannot overcome porn addiction. I don&rsquo;t know how else to say it.</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s no different whether you want to become a successful body builder or a world class sculptor. Practice is the bridge that will help get you there.</p>\n\n<p>You know it. I know it. Everyone knows it.</p>\n\n<p>So what&rsquo;s stopping you?</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>Cravings. Fear. Doubt. Anxiety. Addiction.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>Which is to say there&rsquo;s some kind of internal misunderstanding which is preventing you from doing what you want in your mind.</p>\n\n<p>Yes, a misunderstanding.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps it&rsquo;s a self-limiting belief. Perhaps you haven&rsquo;t developed your awareness to a point that you can act with intention. Perhaps you have no idea what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps you&rsquo;ve never developed a single healthy coping mechanism at all in your entire life.</p>\n\n<p>That&rsquo;s why I came up with <a class=\"link\" href=\"/articles/the-five-fundamental-principles-of-neverfap\">The Five Fundamental Principles of NeverFap</a> in order to help you better understand where you may be misunderstanding yourself.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>Otherwise, known as denial.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>If we had to break down what people tend to find difficult in regards to overcoming their porn addiction.</p>\n\n<p>You could say that it comes down to a) Figuring out how to actually convince oneself to commit to porn recovery and b) Truly understanding what will work, and what will not.</p>\n\n<p>This not only includes the knowledge surrounding porn recovery, but also working with our emotions to effectively apply it in everyday situations.</p>\n\n<p>Which can be incredibly difficult, if not outright confusing when we don&rsquo;t truly have the confidence to know exactly what we&rsquo;re doing.</p>\n\n<p>We&rsquo;ll be feeling completely confident one week into our recovery, only to face what seems like an insurmountable wall of fear and doubt, which inevitably leads to relpase.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>Well, that’s why I decided to create NeverFap Deluxe.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>My intention is to help you fill in all the gaps, so you don’t have to run around like a headless chook, the same way that I did for five years.</p>\n\n<p>In this website, I hope to talk about every single aspect of how to successfully become porn free. What you’ll need to learn. How you can learn those things. How not to fall into certain traps.</p>\n\n<p>How it&rsquo;s actually an incredibly straight-forward process if you just follow the motions.</p>\n\n<p>I want to teach and explain all the core skills that I have come to learn over the past five years over <a class=\"link\" href=\"/articles/my-personal-porn-recovery-journey\">My Personal Porn Recovery Journey</a>, and I want to go into detail as to what these skills and understandings are.</p>\n\n<p>As for a non-exhaustive list of these skills, here are some of the things which you will learn which will help you overcome porn addiction:</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hrul\"/>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Learn to focus on the how, not the why.</li>\n<li>Learn to value your mental health above all.</li>\n<li>Develop the ability to quiet and focus your mind.</li>\n<li>Learn to love and accept yourself and others unconditionally.</li>\n<li>Learn to invest in yourself.</li>\n<li>Change the way you think about sex and women.</li>\n<li>Value commitment and long-term thinking.</li>\n<li>Identify and understanding any potential mental disorders.</li>\n<li>Properly understand how to live life without porn.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr class=\"hrul__bottom\"/>\n\n<p>I explore each of these aspects (and more) in detail, as well as why they are so crucial for in regards to successfully overcoming porn addiction.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr4\"/>\n\n<h4>Personally speaking it took me around 5 years of trial and error before everything finally clicked in my head.</h4>\n\n<hr class=\"hr4__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>And I’m now at a point where porn has no control over me.</p>\n\n<p>Realistically, you could probably achieve the same thing in around six months if you stuck to a rigorous routine.</p>\n\n<p>However, I also maintain that humans simply aren’t like that.</p>\n\n<p>Some of us are driven by failure and by experiencing things the hard way. Others of us may be so deep in our delusion that it may take years to even realise that we have a problem.</p>\n\n<p>That’s okay too.</p>\n\n<p>Understand that we’re not here to fight ourselves any longer.</p>\n\n<p>We’re here to understand who we are, what we have to do to change, as well as understand how we can improve as people.</p>\n","date":"2018-10-15","draft":false,"slug":"introduction-to-the-neverfap-deluxe-guide","categories":["introduction"],"tags":["context","popular","neverfap basics","nofap schedule","porn addiction","addiction","awareness","nofap","neverfap","neverfap deluxe","neverfap deluxe guide","neverfap basics"],"permalink":"https://neverfapdeluxe.com/content_articles/introduction-to-the-neverfap-deluxe-guide/","tldr1":"It is totally possible to overcome porn addiction by following a series of verifiable steps.","tldr2":"Practice is the key to achieving success.","tldr3":"You're likely struggling with porn addiction because of an internal misunderstanding of some fundamental truth.","tldr4":"I created NeverFap Deluxe to help you understand where you may be misunderstanding yourself.","tldr5":"","section":"content_articles"}]
