The Idea Is Not To React, But Instead To Acknowledge That You've Made A Judgement And To Move On.","content":"<!-- TODO: Link to The Easiest Way To Identify A Judgement -->\n\n<p>This exercise is a great way to help you understand when and why you make judgements throughout the day.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, it&rsquo;s a relatively straight-forward exercise, so let&rsquo;s get started!</p>\n\n<p>First of all, I want to start off by saying that there&rsquo;s nothing necessarily wrong with making judgements.</p>\n\n<p>What often happens when people do this exercise, is that they freak out at the true extent of which they&rsquo;re being judgemental.</p>\n\n<p>Which ironically enough, causes people to react with even more judgement and that&rsquo;s exactly what we&rsquo;re trying to avoid.</p>\n\n<p>Sure, being excessively judgemental isn&rsquo;t the best thing for your mental health, however negatively reacting to it is equally as counter-productive.</p>\n\n<!-- NOTE: TODO To understand this exercise, you need to understand the impct of being judgemental on willpower etc. LINK TO ARTICLE -->\n\n<p>Much like with the <strong>Observe Your Senses</strong> exercise, all we really want to do is acknowledge and observe how our mind works.</p>\n\n<p>We&rsquo;re not trying to change our behaviour, nor condemn it in any way.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>In fact, the entire purpose of this exercise is to practice our ability to observe.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>And what a lot of people don&rsquo;t know, is that observation itself is what brings about change.</p>\n\n<p>Not focusing on raw change itself, which usually results in some form of emotional manipulation or judgement - which simply doesn&rsquo;t work as an effective, nor long-term strategy.</p>\n\n<p>Only once we&rsquo;ve mastered observation can we then understand the true nature of effective change, which you&rsquo;ll discover the more you practice observation within your own life.</p>\n\n<p>One thing to keep in mind is that if you are the kind of person who generally reacts with judgement, then this will be a tough exercise for you.</p>\n\n<p>In part because it means you&rsquo;re stuck within your own bubble of unconscious judgement, which you may not quite realise.</p>\n\n<p>But that&rsquo;s okay too.</p>\n\n<p>We all have to start somewhere with addressing certain aspects of our mental health, and this is a great exercise for doing just that.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, your struggle merely becomes another reference point for you to observe. Where you can mentally say to yourself:</p>\n\n<p><strong>&ldquo;Ah, so that&rsquo;s what my mind does when I react to a judgement. Duely noted.&rdquo;</strong></p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr2\"/>\n\n<h2>Instructions</h2>\n\n<hr class=\"hr2__bottom\"/>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>All we want to do with this exercise is catch ourselves and acknowledge when we&rsquo;ve made a judgement.</p>\n\n<p>Now, there&rsquo;s really only one recommended way that you approach this, which is to acknowledge the judgement as I briefly demonstrated above.</p>\n\n<p><strong>&ldquo;Ah, so that&rsquo;s what my mind does. Duely noted.&rdquo;</strong></p>\n\n<p>The idea behind acknowledgement is that we merely want to take note of it, without creating any further judgements.</p>\n\n<p>In essence we want to remain neutral, if not because you should be neutral in all your thoughts anyway.</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s part of what being calm and collected is all about.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, take note of your feelings at the point of judgement. Did you make the judgement because you were feeling angry? Was it because you were feeling depressed?</p>\n\n<p>The reason why this is important is because becoming aware of our feelings is often the easiest way to catch a judgement before it happens.</p>\n\n<p>Essentially, because most judgements produce some sort of feeling in some way, so there&rsquo;s usually a direct correlation between the two.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr4\"/>\n\n<h4>Ultimately, this is an exercise of observation, and observation is the skill we're trying to develop.</h4>\n\n<hr class=\"hr4__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>We&rsquo;re not doing this to feel justified that we caught a judgement. (which funnily enough is a judgement within itself)</p>\n\n<p>We&rsquo;re doing this so we can learn to become more aware of ourselves through observation, and really develop this skill so we can continue to remain aware into the future.</p>\n\n<p>And the sooner we can do this, the sooner we can gain control over our porn addiction.</p>\n\n<!-- \n<hr class=\"hr2\"/>\n\n<h2>Additional Resources</h2>\n\n<hr class=\"hr2__bottom\"/>\n\n\n\n\n\n  -->\n\n<!-- maybe link to other  -->\n","date":"2019-05-12","draft":false,"slug":"catch-out-your-judgements","categories":["uncondition-over-judgement"],"tags":["practice","meditation","porn addiction","addiction","awareness","awareness exercises","perspective","nofap","neverfap","neverfap deluxe"],"permalink":"https://neverfapdeluxe.com/practices/catch-out-your-judgements/","overview":"","category":"Uncondition over judgement","what":"Learn which specific situations cause us to be judgemental.","how":"Make a mental note and observe whenever we make a judgement of any kind.","when":"When you make a judgement.","duration":"2 - 10 seconds per observation.","section":"practices"},{"title":"Focus On Your Finger And Your Background","page_id":"2bc4261b-a813-41d4-84e3-db0650ab07e0","description":"By shifting our visual attention, we can learn more about how the mind operates in regards to where we place our attention.","content":"<p>This is a simple exercise most people can benefit from straight-away without too much effort.</p>\n\n<p>Certainly, it was one of the first awareness exercises I learnt when I was starting out with my own mental health journey, and it&rsquo;s one that has stuck with me since.</p>\n\n<p>This exercise involves manipulating your visual field in order to change the depth perception of the objects in front of you, notably your finger and the foreground.</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s a powerful exercise because humans are largely visual creatures, and so to rapidly change our focus so vividly can help us better understand the power which we have over ourselves and our perception of reality.</p>\n\n<p>At a conscious level, we may not realise the extent to which we have control over ourselves and in particular our thoughts, feelings and even senses.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, demonstrating first-hand that we do have control over these things aspects of our consciousness is a great way to open our minds and dissolve some of the self-limiting beliefs we may have about what we&rsquo;re capable of as people.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, help us detach from the misconceptions within our own minds, including our ego and all things conceptual.</p>\n\n<p>And the fact that what we&rsquo;re doing here is conscious is really key here, as we&rsquo;re trying to demonstrate power over our mind through our actions.</p>\n\n<p>Because that&rsquo;s ultimately what awareness is all about - learning to use our minds effectively so we no longer allow our subconscious fears and behaviours to control who we are.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr2\"/>\n\n<h2>Instructions</h2>\n\n<hr class=\"hr2__bottom\"/>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>While the instructions for this exercise are simple, the real benefit comes from the introspection that comes from practicing this exercise.</p>\n\n<p>No different to any other awareness exercises.</p>\n\n<p>In order to practice this exercise, what you&rsquo;ll want to do is place your hand in front of your face with one finger pointing up.</p>\n\n<p>Essentially, have it far away enough so you can see your finger clearly, but not so close that&hellip; I&rsquo;m sure you get the drift.</p>\n\n<p>Now, what you&rsquo;ll want to do is focus on that finger. Simply focus your vision on that finger, and notice what you see.</p>\n\n<p>If practiced successfully, you should be able to see your finger very clearly. I mean, it is right in front of your face, afterall.</p>\n\n<p>Now, ask yourself a few questions. Are you able to focus on anything else while focusing on your finger? What about the background, are you able to focus on that as well?</p>\n\n<p>Once you&rsquo;ve done this for about a minute-or-so, I now want you to focus your attention on something in the background.</p>\n\n<p>It could be a tree. It could be something on you wall. Generally, the further away it is the better this works.</p>\n\n<p>And with your focus shifted, I want you to gauge your change of perspective and truly understand the significance of what you&rsquo;ve achieved here.</p>\n\n<p>With your focus on that object in the distance, what do you notice? Are you able to see your finger clearly at all?</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, this exercise teaches us a few different things.</p>\n\n<p>It teaches us that although we can have two objects in front of us, where we place our attention ultimately dictates what our experience will be.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, it also teaches us the importance that we play as individuals in regards to how we perceive reality.</p>\n\n<p>When we focused on the background, our finger itself didn&rsquo;t change. What changed was our perception of that finger, due to where we placed our attention.</p>\n\n<p>There are also a number of additional lessons we can learn from this exercise, however I&rsquo;ll leave that up to you to explore!</p>\n\n<!-- TODO: Maybe we need a takeaways section. -->\n\n<!--\n<hr class=\"hr2\"/>\n\n<h2>Additional Resources</h2>\n\n<hr class=\"hr2__bottom\"/>\n\n\n\n\n\n  -->\n\n<!-- maybe link to other  -->\n","date":"2019-05-07","draft":false,"slug":"focus-on-your-finger-and-your-background","categories":["choice-over-mind"],"tags":["practice","meditation","porn addiction","addiction","awareness","awareness exercises","perspective","nofap","neverfap","neverfap deluxe"],"permalink":"https://neverfapdeluxe.com/practices/focus-on-your-finger-and-your-background/","overview":"","category":"Choice over mind","what":"Learn about the significance of moving around our visual attention.","how":"Focusing on our finger in front of us.","when":"When we have a quiet moment to ourselves.","duration":"One minute per object.","section":"practices"},{"title":"What Can Your Hand Do?","page_id":"6f5a6c18-da7e-432f-94db-9733d5301df7","description":"Move your hands, fingers and arms around in order to test your creativity and see which combinations and arrangements you can come up with.","content":"<!-- VERY HAPPY WITH EDIT -->\n\n<p>This exercise is designed to help you think outside of the box.</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s not a particularly difficult exercise in the sense that it allows for unlimited creativity.</p>\n\n<p>However, it&rsquo;s an exercise that&rsquo;s very difficult to master in the traditional sense of being able to consistently replicate the same thing each time.</p>\n\n<p>I find I learn new things each time I try this exercise, and you&rsquo;ll be surprised at the extent to which you&rsquo;ll also discover new things each time you try it too.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>In this exercise what we'll be doing is coming up with a variety of different ways we can use our hands.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>How we can move them.

Alternatively, you may decide to simply imagine something appearing in the right side of your vision.</p>\n\n<p>In a lot of cases, it can be as simple as acknowledging that you have a right arm.

Perhaps you might even want to spin it around 180 degrees, and then throw it behind your back.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>Use your imagination and see what you can do with this object.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>Next, with your eyes still closed, I want you to place your attention on a different object you noticed earlier.</p>\n\n<p>Do the same thing with this object as you did with the previous object.</p>\n\n<p>Rinse and repeat.</p>\n\n<p>While a lot of this may seem silly, the idea behind this exercise is to help you understand that there is nothing concrete, nor necessarily &lsquo;real&rsquo; about our ability to focus.</p>\n\n<p>At the end of the day, it&rsquo;s purely a self-created construct that is developed through practice (and largely desire).</p>\n\n<p>And that really is what I&rsquo;m trying to get at here: Focus is nothing more than a skill that&rsquo;s developed through practice, exactly as you have been doing over the past 5 minutes or so.</p>\n\n<p>There&rsquo;s nothing scary, nor mystic about it.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>It really is as simple as practicing these exercises on a consistent basis, in order to develop the skill of focus.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>Once you understand this, then it helps you realise not only that we have full-control over our attention.</p>\n\n<p>However that we can develop these simple understandings by changing the way we think about reality.</p>\n\n<p>It really is that simple.</p>\n\n<p>The same goes for all your urges and negative feelings surrounding your addiction. Much like your focus and attention, these things are entirely malleable and are in no way bound by anything in particular.</p>\n\n<p>The sooner you realise this, the sooner you&rsquo;ll be able to overcome your addiction without the constant struggle that often comes with fighting our feelings and emotions.</p>\n\n<p>All you have to do is change the way you interpret reality.</p>\n\n<p>By practicing these exercises everyday.</p>\n\n<!-- \n<hr class=\"hr2\"/>\n\n<h2>Additional Resources</h2>\n\n<hr class=\"hr2__bottom\"/>\n\n\n\n\n\n  -->\n\n<!-- maybe link to other  -->\n","date":"2019-04-07","draft":false,"slug":"blind-attention","categories":["awareness-over-all"],"tags":["practice","meditation","porn addiction","addiction","awareness","awareness exercises","perspective","nofap","neverfap","neverfap deluxe"],"permalink":"https://neverfapdeluxe.com/practices/blind-attention/","overview":"","category":"Awareness over all","what":"Develop your ability to focus.","how":"Focus your attention on a particular spot around you within walking distance, with your eyes closed.","when":"When alone in an appropriate and safe setting.","duration":"For one minute at a time.","section":"practices"},{"title":"Where Do You Touch?","page_id":"adc3bccf-a95b-4090-9d47-2cf805a8fbea","description":"By focusing on our sense of touch, we can learn to better understand.","content":"<p><b>Where Do You Touch?</b> is another classic awareness exercise which is designed to help you develop focus and attention.</p>\n\n<p>By &ldquo;classic&rdquo; I mean it&rsquo;s another variation of the tried-and-true &ldquo;pay attention to X thing throughout the day&rdquo; that I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve seen in abundance on this website.</p>\n\n<p>Well, the reason why I write so many of them is because they&rsquo;re incredibly effective at getting you to think about awareness in a unique way.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>In essence, because this is what you should be doing with your attention anyway.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>Which is to say that you should be practicing awareness in everything you do, and that this exercise is merely a shortcut to having you eventually do this automatically.</p>\n\n<p>Awareness is important because it&rsquo;s what allows you to understand and learn your own behaviours, not only to change them, but also to enhance them.</p>\n\n<p>By practicing awareness in any capacity, we train our ability to catch ourselves doing silly things, like watching porn when we&rsquo;re feeling stressed.</p>\n\n<p>And instead, consciously decide within that moment, to replace that unhealthy coping mechanism with a healthy coping mechanism instead.</p>\n\n<p>The more we practice this, the more it will help us to think in terms of using our awareness in an empowering way, and eventually it will become second-nature to us.</p>\n\n<p>Overtime we will become more aware of all our behaviours and quirks, and this is when we will develop full-control over our lives.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr2\"/>\n\n<h2>Instructions</h2>\n\n<hr class=\"hr2__bottom\"/>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>In this exercise we&rsquo;re going to be paying attention to our body and how it interacts with touch.</p>\n\n<p>Essentially, I want you to take note of whenever you&rsquo;re touching something.</p>\n\n<p>For example, I&rsquo;m currently using my fingers to tap against this keyboard in order to type these words.</p>\n\n<p>And yet although it&rsquo;s something I spend most my day doing, it&rsquo;s not something I&rsquo;ve ever really thought about.</p>\n\n<p>Well, that&rsquo;s precisely the problem we&rsquo;re trying to address.

It could be using your phone.</p>\n\n<p>It could be any number of things and I want you to take note of a few things which will help you get the most out of this exercise.</p>\n\n<p>For starters, I want you to notice the physical feeling of using your non-dominant hand. What does it feel like to use your other hand in ways you&rsquo;ve probably never used before?</p>\n\n<p>Does it feel unnatural? Does it feel slightly unreal? Is the task just as easy to complete with your non-dominant hand? In what ways does it feel similar?

It&rsquo;s just that some exercises a lot simpler to execute than others.</p>\n\n<p>One thing you&rsquo;ll notice as you trawl this website, is that there are a range of different exercises which all seem quite similar to each other.</p>\n\n<p>This includes <a class=\"link\" href=\"/practices/slow-it-down\">Slow Down Time</a> where we attempt to slow down and speed up reality, as well as <a class=\"link\" href=\"/practices/stop-absolutely-everything-you-are-doing\">Stop Absolutely Everything You&rsquo;re Doing</a> where we attempt to shut down our mind completely, as if we&rsquo;ve consciously flicked off a switch at the back of our minds.</p>\n\n<p>The idea is that with different perspectives, we can learn to understand ourselves and our conscious experience with a more open mind, as well as embrace different ways of thinking.</p>\n\n<p>So that we can effectively challenge the denial that comes with being an addict.</p>\n\n<p>With <strong>Relax Everything</strong>, what we&rsquo;re essentially trying to do is learn to relax and let go, as opposed to say, consciously manipulate our interpretation of reality or make judgements about how we&rsquo;re feeling.</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s a skill which will allow us to effectively deal with our urges and uncomfortable feelings and emotions.</p>\n\n<p>An important thing to keep in mind with these awareness exercises is that while we&rsquo;re ultimately aiming to develop hard skills, it&rsquo;s also important for us to focus on the introspection aspect of these exercises as well.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, how these different exercises make us feel as we practice them.</p>\n\n<p>From an introspection point of view, we&rsquo;re not necessarily trying to &lsquo;achieve&rsquo; anything per-say.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, what we&rsquo;re merely attempting to do is observe and develop our ability to view ourselves with a more open mind.</p>\n\n<p>Essentially, it&rsquo;s a very effective way to learn mastery over your thoughts and emotions.</p>\n\n<p>So whenever you&rsquo;re doing these kinds of exercises, remember to always try and guage how you feel. Does the exercise make you feel frustrated? Do you think anything at all?</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr4\"/>\n\n<h4>If you skip this step, then you'll gain very little from these exercises because you won't be actively engaging your brain.</h4>\n\n<hr class=\"hr4__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>And if you don&rsquo;t engage your brain, then you won&rsquo;t engage in physical changes that take place between your neural connections, and subscequently you won&rsquo;t be truly changing in the sense of conscious realisation.</p>\n\n<p>So ask yourself when doing the exercise:</p>\n\n<p>Do you feel more comfortable when you relax? Is there anything you don&rsquo;t like about relaxing? How does it compare to other awareness exercises? Do you even understand what it means to be relaxed at all?</p>\n\n<p>Remember, this is a process of self-discovery.</p>\n\n<p>There are no right or wrong answers.</p>\n\n<p>There is only what you feel and how you perceive.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr2\"/>\n\n<h2>Instructions</h2>\n\n<hr class=\"hr2__bottom\"/>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>For this exercise, what we want to do is relax and you can do this whenever you want.</p>\n\n<p>I personally find it&rsquo;s quite effective to engage in this activity while doing something, because it&rsquo;s arguably easier to relax when you&rsquo;re in a non-relaxed state, as opposed to sitting silently in a chair.</p>\n\n<p>So what does it mean to relax?</p>\n\n<p>Well, let&rsquo;s start with some of the physical attributes.</p>\n\n<p>Relaxing from a physical perspective means letting go of all the tension in your body. It means slowing your mental pace, as well as taking things easy.</p>\n\n<p>If I had to describe the essence of relaxation, I would say that it&rsquo;s about experiencing life without obligation or care. You just are.</p>\n\n<p>It means not worrying about anything, because you know what? There&rsquo;s simply no obligation to worry, because when you are relaxed you have no responsibilty to anything.</p>\n\n<p>Again, I urge you to remember that this is a process of self-discovery, and that I&rsquo;m not asking you to permanently dissolve into a puddle of jelly.</p>\n\n<p>These are short bursts of perspective I am asking you to engage in throughout the day, in order to develop a more open mind.</p>\n\n<p>Certainly, while I can describe what relaxation is all day, unless if you actually attempt to practice it, then you simply won&rsquo;t learn what it actually is, nor be able to effectively use it when required.</p>\n\n<p>One key thing to understand about relaxation is that it&rsquo;s a feeling, so if you can&rsquo;t feel it on demand, then you won&rsquo;t be able to cope when you find yourself in a situation where you feel compelled to watch porn or do something equally self-destructive.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, relaxation is one of the many health coping mechanisms we will be developing in order to help us cope with life in a more effective way.</p>\n\n<!-- \n<hr class=\"hr2\"/>\n\n<h2>Additional Resources</h2>\n\n<hr class=\"hr2__bottom\"/>\n\n\n\n\n\n  -->\n\n<!-- maybe link to other  -->\n","date":"2019-02-13","draft":false,"slug":"relax-everything","categories":["struggle-over-none"],"tags":["practice","meditation","porn addiction","addiction","awareness","awareness exercises","perspective","nofap","neverfap","neverfap deluxe"],"permalink":"https://neverfapdeluxe.com/practices/relax-everything/","overview":"","category":"Struggle over none","what":"Learn to relax youself into specific situations.","how":"Give up all care and completely let go of everything you're thinking and feeling.","when":"As often as possible throughout the day whilst in the middle of doing something.","duration":"2 - 10 seconds per situation.","section":"practices"},{"title":"Dissolve Your Visual Field","page_id":"81958d95-93bd-41a7-b14f-2798ca89947c","description":"Learn to dissolve your ego by manipulating your visual perception of reality. treat your visual field as a simple plane of a light and colour.","content":"<!-- VERY HAPPY WITH EDIT -->\n\n<p>This exercise is designed to help dissolve your ego.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>In particular, by getting you actively reinterpret your visual field.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>Before we commence however, we must first come to understand how humans interpret reality.</p>\n\n<p>On a conceptual level, humans relate to the world with language. We use words and symbols in order to define and describe the world around us.</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s what allows us to gauge social situations, learn new theoretical concepts and better understand the relationship between ourselves and our environment.</p>\n\n<p>And yet, although we live in this predefined world of assumptions based on our conceptual understanding of the world.</p>\n\n<p>None of it is actually &lsquo;real&rsquo;.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>Numbers, for example, are not real. They're just mathematical descriptions.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>On a cultural level, this conceptuality extends to all the predefined rules we have in regards to how we should act and behave.</p>\n\n<p>For example, some cultures prefer kissing as opposed to shaking hands as a way to greet others &hellip;and yet this preference doesn&rsquo;t actually help describe what humans are.</p>\n\n<p>Although society attempts to define us based on our behaviours and how we act, it still doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that we all have five fingers, two eyes and need to be loved.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>We're all still merely people, after all.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>By the same token, our addiction to porn maintains a very similar same layer of conceptual &lsquo;description&rsquo; which prevents us from truly seeing what we&rsquo;re actually doing.</p>\n\n<p>For example, we can find ourselves drawn to certain types of porn or online fetishes.</p>\n\n<p>Even though, when you think about it, it&rsquo;s all just a bunch of light emanating from our computer screens.</p>\n\n<p>Which when you put it like that, makes porn addiction seem quite silly.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>I mean, is that arrangement of light and colour on your computer screen really that special enough for you to be completely dependent upon it?</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>Essentially, what we intend to do with this exercise is help your brain distinguish between what you see (i.e. light and colour).</p>\n\n<p>In contrast to that extra layer of conceptuality clouding your vision (i.e. the actual person standing in front of you).</p>\n\n<p>We want to remove this bias from our visual understanding of reality, not only to see a &lsquo;clearer&rsquo; picture of reality, but to better understand what we&rsquo;re actually experiencing.</p>\n\n<p>So really, what we&rsquo;re trying to discover is.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>What information do we lose with all this additional mental processing?</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>Can we call what we even see with this additional processing &lsquo;reality&rsquo;?</p>\n\n<p>Is it possible to truly &lsquo;see&rsquo; when our minds are in a constant state of evaluation?</p>\n\n<p>These are the questions will be attempting to answer and of course, it can help to understand that there are many ways we cloud our vision with description.</p>\n\n<p>For example, we typically use a variety of objects in our visual field to construct depth. Then, we often evaluate those objects. Are they alive? Are they human? Are they dangerous?</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, this is the process we are trying to understand.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr2\"/>\n\n<h2>Instructions</h2>\n\n<hr class=\"hr2__bottom\"/>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>For this exercise, what we want to do is attempt to treat our visual field as a simple plane of a light and colour.</p>\n\n<p>No objects. No descriptions. No focusing on certain details over another. No intepretations.</p>\n\n<p>Nuthin&rsquo;.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, what we want to do is treat our visual field as a non-descript arrangement of light and colour.</p>\n\n<p>It usually helps to imagine everything as a cloud of sensation, although I&rsquo;m sure there are other more meaningful ways to describe it.</p>\n\n<p>Certainly, don&rsquo;t try to focus.</p>\n\n<p>Keep your attention wide and merely feel as if you&rsquo;re intaking the visual information around you, rather than from the point of view of you actively perceiving that information.</p>\n\n<p>While you can do this anywhere, I personally find it works best when I have a few minutes alone, where you can really explore this idea uninterupted.</p>\n","date":"2019-02-03","draft":false,"slug":"dissolve-your-visual-field","categories":["awareness-over-all"],"tags":["practice","meditation","visual meditation","porn addiction","addiction","awareness","awareness exercises","perspective","nofap","neverfap","neverfap deluxe"],"permalink":"https://neverfapdeluxe.com/practices/dissolve-your-visual-field/","overview":"","category":"Awareness over all","what":"Reinterpret your visual field in order to help dissolve your ego.","how":"Treat your visual field as nothing more than a simple plane of a light and colour.","when":"In a calm setting where you're able to focus on something visually.","duration":"5 - 10 minutes per session.","section":"practices"},{"title":"Observe Your Senses","page_id":"553d1722-92bc-494a-b7ad-49cf9239446d","description":"Observation is one of the most powerful ways we can to build our awareness and learn to regain control over our porn addiction.","content":"<!-- VERY HAPPY WITH THIS -->\n\n<!-- <hr class=\"hr2\"/>\n\n<h2>Context</h2>\n\n<hr class=\"hr2__bottom\"/>\n\n\n\n\n\n -->\n\n<p>This exercise encompasses one of the most fundamental skills in regards to practicing meditation.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr4\"/>\n\n<h4>Your ability to remain aware of your senses in the present moment.</h4>\n\n<hr class=\"hr4__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s a skill which will form the foundation of almost all the practices on this website, in particular the introspection aspect of these practices i.e. how these exercises make you feel as you practice them.</p>\n\n<p>The interesting thing about this exercise is that despite the inherent simplicity of what it is, it&rsquo;s an exercise most people struggle with.</p>\n\n<p>In part, because of the great amount of misunderstanding and confusion surrounding what &lsquo;observation&rsquo; truly is.</p>\n\n<p>And this happens for a number of reasons.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>For starters, we severely overcomplicate what it is, thinking it must be so much more than simply paying attention to what we're feeling.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>Instead, we develop this idea that it must be this highly-trained skill that only Bhuddist monks can attain following years of practice in a remote location.</p>\n\n<p>So what ends up happening is put all this effort and strain into trying to develop this &lsquo;zen-like&rsquo; state of mind, which ends up exhausting us more than it does helping us.</p>\n\n<p>We become so distracted in the expectation of what observation should be, that we ironically spend all our mental effort judging and feeling pressured, rather than observing at all.</p>\n\n<p>So let&rsquo;s change that.</p>\n\n<p>To put it into the most simple terms I know how.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>Observation is nothing more than paying attention to your senses.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>If you&rsquo;re at a cafe for example, it means paying attention to the sounds of the people chatting around you, what the atmosphere around you smells like etc.</p>\n\n<p>Because when you think about it, you&rsquo;re already observing reality.</p>\n\n<p>You&rsquo;re already breathing. You&rsquo;re already blinking. You&rsquo;re already seeing.</p>\n\n<p>You simply haven&rsquo;t applied that extra step of making yourself aware of all those things which you are currently doing.</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s literally that simple.</p>\n\n<p>You don&rsquo;t need to attempt to find something that&rsquo;s not there, nor even manipulate your interpretation of what you&rsquo;re feeling or thinking via thought or judgement.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, it&rsquo;s about noticing your surroundings, thoughts and feelings, in addition to any particular reactions you may be having to those aspects of your reality. Hell, perhaps you&rsquo;re not even thinking or feeling at all?</p>\n\n<p>That&rsquo;s for you to discover.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr4\"/>\n\n<h4>Where I personally feel a lot of people explaining observation go wrong, is that they focus on this whole \"really try to empty your thoughts\" or \"attempt to refrain from judgement\" mindset.</h4>\n\n<hr class=\"hr4__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>Because it essentially implies that you have to do &ldquo;more&rdquo; to somehow achieve what is effectively an empty state of mind.</p>\n\n<p>Which doesn&rsquo;t make any sense, and is even contradictory.</p>\n\n<p>You don&rsquo;t have to change anything. Observation isn&rsquo;t about changing anything or setting expectations. It&rsquo;s the exact opposite of that.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, it&rsquo;s about observing what you&rsquo;re currently sensing via your thoughts and emotions.</p>\n\n<p>So don&rsquo;t worry about trying to prevent your thoughts, or getting frustrating if you can&rsquo;t stop thinking.</p>\n\n<p>That&rsquo;s precisely the problem we&rsquo;re trying to address, and the way we do that is by focusing on the task at hand, which is observation itself.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr4\"/>\n\n<h4>Another important thing to keep in mind is that we're not necessarily attempting to 'achieve' anything with observation.</h4>\n\n<hr class=\"hr4__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>Instead, what we&rsquo;re doing is exploring.</p>\n\n<p>We&rsquo;re exploring how we feel, how we think, as well as discovering what we personally find enjoyable and empowering.</p>\n\n<p>So that we can better understand ourselves.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr2\"/>\n\n<h2>Instructions</h2>\n\n<hr class=\"hr2__bottom\"/>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This exercise is outrageously simple.</p>\n\n<p>Observe your senses.</p>\n\n<p>Observe what you&rsquo;re feeling. Observe what you&rsquo;re thinking. Observe what&rsquo;s around you.</p>\n\n<p>The world is your oyster.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr4\"/>\n\n<h4>Observe all the various interactions that are taking place in your mind.</h4>\n\n<hr class=\"hr4__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s about sitting there (or standing, or walking, or whatever you happen to be doing) and paying attention to what you&rsquo;re sensing, whether it be thought, emotion or absolutely nothing at all.</p>\n\n<p>And remember, you&rsquo;re not attempting to change anything here. Instead you&rsquo;re merely keeping note and acknowledging the cloud of sensation that is your reality.</p>\n\n<p>Certainly, you may struggle with it initially.</p>\n\n<p>Which is to say that you may not be used to simply observing, and instead be in a constant state of reaction and judgement.</p>\n\n<p>That&rsquo;s okay too. It&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re practicing this exercise, so we can improve and develop these skills.</p>\n\n<p>So don&rsquo;t be alarmed if you find observation to be difficult.</p>\n\n<p>There&rsquo;s always a first for everything.</p>\n\n<!-- \n<hr class=\"hr2\"/>\n\n<h2>Additional Resources</h2>\n\n<hr class=\"hr2__bottom\"/>\n\n\n\n\n\n  -->\n\n<!-- maybe link to other  -->\n","date":"2019-01-27","draft":false,"slug":"observe-your-senses","categories":["introduction"],"tags":["practice","meditation","porn addiction","addiction","awareness","awareness exercises","perspective","nofap","neverfap","neverfap deluxe"],"permalink":"https://neverfapdeluxe.com/practices/observe-your-senses/","overview":"","category":"Introduction","what":"Learn to build your skills of observation in order to meditate and practice awareness exercises effectively.","how":"Pay attention to what you're sensing (i.e. hearing, feeling, seeing etc.)","when":"Anytime during the day.","duration":"As long as you want.","section":"practices"},{"title":"Stop Absolutely Everything You're Doing","page_id":"45783e55-cbff-4acb-a594-821cb7382fd7","description":"Mentally stopping everything in our mind is one of the quickest ways you can learn to dictate control over yourself.","content":"<!-- VERY HAPPY WITH THIS -->\n\n<!-- <hr class=\"hr2\"/>\n\n<h2>Context</h2>\n\n<hr class=\"hr2__bottom\"/>\n\n\n\n\n\n -->\n\n<p>I love this exercise.</p>\n\n<p>I can&rsquo;t quite tell if this exercise is an analogue to <a class=\"link\" href=\"/articles/slow-down-your-perception-of-time\">Slow Down Your Perception Of Time</a> or a percursor to it, however they&rsquo;re both different approaches to the same concept of awareness.</p>\n\n<p>Usually you&rsquo;ll end up using both in conjunction, but it&rsquo;s arguably easier to learn them as separate, unique skills.</p>\n\n<p>All awareness exercises essentially come down to finding different ways to break down you perception of who you are.</p>\n\n<p>And this is a very important practice because our perception of who we are, isn&rsquo;t actually who we are.</p>\n\n<p>It is merely an identity we carry to help us navigate through life.</p>\n\n<p>And when we don&rsquo;t realise this, or aren&rsquo;t consciously aware of this label that we prescribe to ourselves on a daily basis, then we can become ransom to this persona.</p>\n\n<p>By learning to understand this identity, we provide ourselves with the opportunity to be able to directly control how we operate, without relying on the expectations of this persona.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr4\"/>\n\n<h4>What this exercise attempts to do is help you better disassociate yourself from this persona.</h4>\n\n<hr class=\"hr4__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>The end goal isn&rsquo;t necessarily to completely dissolve this persona.</p>\n\n<p>(Not that there&rsquo;s anything wrong with dissolving it.

Rather, it&rsquo;s a complex relationship which evokes a whole range of feelings and emotions.</p>\n\n<p>Porn is also feeling immense guilt for having relapsed, porn is feeling completely empty and drained on the inside, porn is the shame of lying about our habit to our friends and family.</p>\n\n<p>Yet when you think about it, porn really is nothing more than &ldquo;two people having sex&rdquo;.</p>\n\n<p>Sure, it&rsquo;s something that a lot of humans find destructively addictive, but it&rsquo;s hard to deny that from a visual perspective, there really is nothing that awful about it.</p>\n\n<p>With this in mind, what this exercise attempts to do is help you come to the understand that porn is simply &ldquo;two people having sex&rdquo;.</p>\n\n<p>And the way we do this is by separating what we feel and what we see into two different categories.</p>\n\n<p>Because currently we may have developed a habit of jumbling the two together, and not quite realising all the steps our mind makes internal when jumping to the conclusion of &ldquo;I really want to watch porn&rdquo;.</p>\n\n<p>One thing to notice is that this exercise may seem incredibly similar to <a class=\"link\" href=\"/practices/dissolve-your-visual-perception-of-reality/\">Dissolve Your Visual Perception Of Reality</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Both exercises focus on manipulating our visual understanding in some way, however both exercises do completely different things.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Dissolve Your Visual Perception Of Reality</strong> attempts to completely absolve our understanding of reality, while this exercise attempts to rearrange our understanding of it.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr2\"/>\n\n<h2>Instructions</h2>\n\n<hr class=\"hr2__bottom\"/>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>For this exercise, what we want to do is look at some things, and try and figure out the difference between what we&rsquo;re seeing and what we&rsquo;re feeling.</p>\n\n<p>We can do this sitting down at home, or anywhere really. Observe what you see. Observe what you feel.</p>\n\n<p>It could be a building. It could be another person. I tend to do this exercise using everyday objects, although sentimental objects can work well too.</p>\n\n<p>Especially objects that we&rsquo;ve kept around the house for a while, that you&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time with. (for example, it could be a video game console)</p>\n\n<p>Can you distinguish any difference between the object and the feeling? What are those differences? Is there even a difference?</p>\n\n<p>Is there any feeling at all, and are you responsible for creating that feeling or is it the object which is responsible for how you feel</p>\n\n<p>Play around with it.</p>\n\n<p>Try this exercises in different areas and different places. See if you can discover any common themes.</p>\n\n<p>The world truly is your oyster ^^</p>\n\n<!-- \n<hr class=\"hr2\"/>\n\n<h2>Additional Resources</h2>\n\n<hr class=\"hr2__bottom\"/>\n\n\n\n\n\n  -->\n\n<!-- maybe link to other  -->\n","date":"2019-01-12","draft":false,"slug":"separate-your-seeing-from-your-feeling","categories":["uncondition-over-judgement"],"tags":["practice","meditation","porn addiction","addiction","awareness","awareness exercises","perspective","nofap","neverfap","neverfap deluxe"],"permalink":"https://neverfapdeluxe.com/practices/separate-your-seeing-from-your-feeling/","overview":"","category":"Uncondition over judgement","what":"Develop awareness by distinguishing our thought/feelings from our visual perception.","how":"Look at an object/area and attempt to separate your thought/feelings from what you're actually seeing.","when":"Alone in a calm setting where you're able to reflect.","duration":"5 - 10 minutes per session.","section":"practices"},{"title":"Focus Your Attention","page_id":"1137e7d2-a459-4012-b572-3dd3ee26facd","description":"Focus your attention and learn to gain control over what our minds pay attention to.","content":"<!-- VERY HAPPY WITH THIS -->\n\n<p>Learning to focus our attention is an important skill.</p>\n\n<p>However, I would also argue that it&rsquo;s quite an advanced skill that should only be attempted once you feel more comfortable being aware in general.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s an exercise which builds upon <a class=\"link\" href=\"/practices/observe-your-senses\">Observe Your Senses</a> so it makes sense to master that first.</p>\n\n<p>Otherwise, we can truly struggle with this exercise, and more often than not when people attempt to learn this exercise first, it almost always leads to more confusion than clarity.</p>\n\n<p>So please do not proceed until you&rsquo;ve mastered more fundamental awareness exercises.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr2\"/>\n\n<h2>What is focus?</h2>\n\n<hr class=\"hr2__bottom\"/>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The funny thing about focus is that it&rsquo;s a bit of a paradox, at least according to conventional wisdom.</p>\n\n<p>A lot of people treat focus as if it&rsquo;s supposed to be this kind of intense period of concentration, which is designed to consume all you energy and attention.</p>\n\n<p>In reality, effective focus is not like that and cannot come from tensing up and trying &lsquo;really hard&rsquo; to get into that mental zone.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>Instead, effective focus comes from being calm and relaxed with a clear intention in mind.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m sure anyone could maintain intense focus by trying &lsquo;really hard&rsquo; however it certainly wouldn&rsquo;t be effective in the sense of being in control.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, you cannot focus effectively if you&rsquo;re spending all your mental energy on creating an environment in which you feel comfortable to focus.</p>\n\n<p>Because then you&rsquo;re left with significantly less energy to actually focus, and instead it leaves you incredibly vulnerable and quite ironically, without focus.</p>\n\n<p>Definitely, not fun.</p>\n\n<p>As stated earlier, if I had to describe what focus is.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3\"/>\n\n<h3>I would say that it's nothing more than awareness with a clear intention.</h3>\n\n<hr class=\"hr3__bottom\"/>\n\n\n<p>Which is to say that it&rsquo;s the same thing as being aware in the traditional sense (i.e. observation), only now you&rsquo;re choosing an intention outside of simply being aware of your senses.</p>\n\n<p>This is why I say that you must first learn to master basic awareness before moving onto these kinds of exercises.</p>\n\n<p>Because it actually requires more skill to remain calm and aware, while also selectively focusing on a certain aspect of your awareness.</p>\n\n<p>Which people generally find more difficult than simply being aware of all their sense.</p>\n\n<p>In essence, it&rsquo;s easier to be fully attuned to all your senses at once without focus, than it is to be fully attuned to just one of your senses</p>\n\n<p>Simply because there&rsquo;s less overhead.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"hr2\"/>\n\n<h2>Instructions</h2>\n\n<hr class=\"hr2__bottom\"/>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>There are essentially two key steps towards performing this exercise.</p>\n\n<p>First, relax and put yourself into a state of unconditional awareness, as per the instructions in <a class=\"link\" href=\"/practices/observe-your-senses\">Observe Your Senses</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In this state of mind, you should have completely emptied your mind and become fully attuned to your senses.</p>\n\n<p>Then, once you have achieved this, attempt to place your attention on a very particular aspect of your awareness.</p>\n\n<p>It could be something visual, like a lamp or a door. It could be a sound that is occurring in the background. It could be a physical sensation that you&rsquo;re experiencing in your body.</p>\n\n<p>Play around with it and see where your mind takes you.</p>\n\n<!--  <hr class=\"hr2\"/>\n\n<h2>Additional Resources</h2>\n\n<hr class=\"hr2__bottom\"/>\n\n\n\n\n\n  -->\n\n<!-- maybe link to other  -->\n","date":"2019-01-04","draft":false,"slug":"focus-your-attention","categories":["awareness-over-all"],"tags":["practice","meditation","porn addiction","addiction","awareness","awareness exercises","perspective","nofap","neverfap","neverfap deluxe"],"permalink":"https://neverfapdeluxe.com/practices/focus-your-attention/","overview":"","category":"Awareness over all","what":"Placing focus with your attention in order to develop your ability to focus.","how":"Focus your attention on some particular aspect (i.e. breath) for the entire duration of the exercise.","when":"Alone in a calm setting where you're able to reflect.","duration":"5 - 10 minutes per session.","section":"practices"}]
