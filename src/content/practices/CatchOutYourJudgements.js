<Text style={p}>This exercise is a great way to help you understand when and why you make judgements throughout the day.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Furthermore, it&rsquo;s a relatively straight-forward exercise, so let&rsquo;s get started!</Text>

<Text style={p}>First of all, I want to start off by saying that there&rsquo;s nothing necessarily wrong with making judgements.</Text>

<Text style={p}>What often happens when people do this exercise, is that they freak out at the true extent of which they&rsquo;re being judgemental.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Which ironically enough, causes people to react with even more judgement and that&rsquo;s exactly what we&rsquo;re trying to avoid.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Sure, being excessively judgemental isn&rsquo;t the best thing for your mental health, however negatively reacting to it is equally as counter-productive.</Text>



<Text style={p}>Much like with the <Text style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>Observe Your Senses</Text> exercise, all we really want to do is acknowledge and observe how our mind works.</Text>

<Text style={p}>We&rsquo;re not trying to change our behaviour, nor condemn it in any way.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>In fact, the entire purpose of this exercise is to practice our ability to observe.</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>And what a lot of people don&rsquo;t know, is that observation itself is what brings about change.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Not focusing on raw change itself, which usually results in some form of emotional manipulation or judgement - which simply doesn&rsquo;t work as an effective, nor long-term strategy.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Only once we&rsquo;ve mastered observation can we then understand the true nature of effective change, which you&rsquo;ll discover the more you practice observation within your own life.</Text>

<Text style={p}>One thing to keep in mind is that if you are the kind of person who generally reacts with judgement, then this will be a tough exercise for you.</Text>

<Text style={p}>In part because it means you&rsquo;re stuck within your own bubble of unconscious judgement, which you may not quite realise.</Text>

<Text style={p}>But that&rsquo;s okay too.</Text>

<Text style={p}>We all have to start somewhere with addressing certain aspects of our mental health, and this is a great exercise for doing just that.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Furthermore, your struggle merely becomes another reference point for you to observe. Where you can mentally say to yourself:</Text>

<Text style={p}><Text style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>&ldquo;Ah, so that&rsquo;s what my mind does when I react to a judgement. Duely noted.&rdquo;</Text></Text>

<View style={hr2}/>

<Text style={h2}>Instructions</Text>

<View style={hr2__bottom}/>







<Text style={p}>All we want to do with this exercise is catch ourselves and acknowledge when we&rsquo;ve made a judgement.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Now, there&rsquo;s really only one recommended way that you approach this, which is to acknowledge the judgement as I briefly demonstrated above.</Text>

<Text style={p}><Text style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>&ldquo;Ah, so that&rsquo;s what my mind does. Duely noted.&rdquo;</Text></Text>

<Text style={p}>The idea behind acknowledgement is that we merely want to take note of it, without creating any further judgements.</Text>

<Text style={p}>In essence we want to remain neutral, if not because you should be neutral in all your thoughts anyway.</Text>

<Text style={p}>It&rsquo;s part of what being calm and collected is all about.</Text>

<Text style={p}>In addition, take note of your feelings at the point of judgement. Did you make the judgement because you were feeling angry? Was it because you were feeling depressed?</Text>

<Text style={p}>The reason why this is important is because becoming aware of our feelings is often the easiest way to catch a judgement before it happens.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Essentially, because most judgements produce some sort of feeling in some way, so there&rsquo;s usually a direct correlation between the two.</Text>

<View style={hr4}/>

<Text style={h4}>Ultimately, this is an exercise of observation, and observation is the skill we're trying to develop.</Text>

<View style={hr4__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>We&rsquo;re not doing this to feel justified that we caught a judgement. (which funnily enough is a judgement within itself)</Text>

<Text style={p}>We&rsquo;re doing this so we can learn to become more aware of ourselves through observation, and really develop this skill so we can continue to remain aware into the future.</Text>

<Text style={p}>And the sooner we can do this, the sooner we can gain control over our porn addiction.</Text>
