<Text style={p}>This is a great exercise in terms of being able to understand what it means to truly focus our minds and train our attention.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Part of the reason why many of us struggle with this idea of focus, is because many of us have this very rigid understanding of what focus is, as a &ldquo;hardcore&rdquo; state of mind that is attained in a very specific way.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Usually via intense meditation and awareness study, as well as an almost exquiste sense of self-control over our minds.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Well, I&rsquo;m here to tell you that it&rsquo;s quite the opposite.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>In actual fact, focus and attention are largely conceptual ideas which have no rigid implementation.</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>Which is to say that there is no one, nor necessarily correct way to obtain focus. And that all the limitations we perceive about our own ability to focus, are purely self-made.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Certainly, this isn&rsquo;t to say that you may not be struggling with developing focus.</Text>

<Text style={p}>However, it merely indicates that the perceived limitations we have in regards to our inability to focus can be solved with a simple change of mind.</Text>

<Text style={p}>And the way we are going to do this is by playing around with our focus and attention in a unique way.</Text>

<Text style={p}>I would definitely describe it as a fun exercise, which ultimately has you utilising your imagination in order to practice the unlimited number of ways we can develop and utilise focus.</Text>

<Text style={p}>It will also help introduce you to a way of thinking which has unique applications when it comes to learning, if you so choose to use it.</Text>

<Text style={h2}>Instructions</Text>

<View style={hr2__bottom}/>







<Text style={p}>In order to practice this exercise, you&rsquo;ll first need to pay attention to your surroundings.</Text>

<Text style={p}>For starters, attempt to take note of the various objects within your surrounding area.</Text>

<Text style={p}>It could be a door. It could be a lamp on your desk. Perhaps even a plant or tree outside.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Now, with this information in mind I want you to place your focus and attention onto one of these objects.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Noticing this object, I want you to really take note of it&rsquo;s shape, as well as how the object would feel in your hands or what you would do if you had to interact with it.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Really think about this object and place it at the centre of your conscious attention.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>Now, with your attention remained on this object, I want you to close your eyes.</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>Continuing to pay attention to this object, can you still feel it&rsquo;s presence in spite of the fact that you cannot see it?</Text>

<Text style={p}>Afterall the object is still there in your mind, and your attention is still on that object as if it were there, visually in front of you.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Now, with your eyes still closed, I now want you to imagine as if you&rsquo;re moving that object around with your mind.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Perhaps you might want to lift it up and move it to around to your left. Perhaps you might even want to spin it around 180 degrees, and then throw it behind your back.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>Use your imagination and see what you can do with this object.</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>Next, with your eyes still closed, I want you to place your attention on a different object you noticed earlier.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Do the same thing with this object as you did with the previous object.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Rinse and repeat.</Text>

<Text style={p}>While a lot of this may seem silly, the idea behind this exercise is to help you understand that there is nothing concrete, nor necessarily &lsquo;real&rsquo; about our ability to focus.</Text>

<Text style={p}>At the end of the day, it&rsquo;s purely a self-created construct that is developed through practice (and largely desire).</Text>

<Text style={p}>And that really is what I&rsquo;m trying to get at here: Focus is nothing more than a skill that&rsquo;s developed through practice, exactly as you have been doing over the past 5 minutes or so.</Text>

<Text style={p}>There&rsquo;s nothing scary, nor mystic about it.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>It really is as simple as practicing these exercises on a consistent basis, in order to develop the skill of focus.</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>Once you understand this, then it helps you realise not only that we have full-control over our attention.</Text>

<Text style={p}>However that we can develop these simple understandings by changing the way we think about reality.</Text>

<Text style={p}>It really is that simple.</Text>

<Text style={p}>The same goes for all your urges and negative feelings surrounding your addiction. Much like your focus and attention, these things are entirely malleable and are in no way bound by anything in particular.</Text>

<Text style={p}>The sooner you realise this, the sooner you&rsquo;ll be able to overcome your addiction without the constant struggle that often comes with fighting our feelings and emotions.</Text>

<Text style={p}>All you have to do is change the way you interpret reality.</Text>

<Text style={p}>By practicing these exercises everyday.</Text>
