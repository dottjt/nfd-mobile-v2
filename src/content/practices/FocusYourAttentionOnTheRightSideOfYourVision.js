          <Text style={p}>This is another classic awareness exercise which is short and straight-to-the-point.</Text>

<Text style={p}>It&rsquo;s designed to help you think about something which you ordinarily wouldn&rsquo;t think about, which can help you expand your conscious awareness.</Text>

<Text style={p}>I suppose what I like about this particular variation of awareness exercise, is that it really points out how subtle our focus and attention can be.</Text>

<Text style={p}>While there are much more demanding awareness exercises such as Observe Your Senses this exercise highlights that focus and attention can still be achieved in the day-to-day of our busy lives.</Text>

<Text style={p}>And that&rsquo;s really the beauty of focus and attention.</Text>

<Text style={p}>As outlined in Blind Attention it can be absolutely anything you want it to be, it simply comes down to your ability to conceptually think about it in everyday situations, and this exercise is designed to help you do that.</Text>

<Text style={p}>So without further ado, let&rsquo;s get to the meat of it.</Text>

<Text style={h2}>Instructions</Text>

<View style={hr2__bottom}/>







<Text style={p}>For this exercise what you want to do is focus your attention on the right side of your vision.</Text>

<Text style={p}>I find this exercise works most effectively while you&rsquo;re in the middle of doing something, because it&rsquo;s not designed to be particularly taxing.</Text>

<Text style={p}>In fact, it&rsquo;s designed to exist as a subtle overlay over your current thinking and daily functioning, as opposed to a dedicated practice you do when you have 10 minutes to yourself.</Text>

<Text style={p}>I tend to find the real benefit of this exercise comes from how we decide to focus on the right side of our vision.</Text>

<Text style={p}>For example, you may want to physically look at something in the right side of your vision. Alternatively, you may decide to simply imagine something appearing in the right side of your vision.</Text>

<Text style={p}>In a lot of cases, it can be as simple as acknowledging that you have a right arm. There&rsquo;s an infinite number of ways you can practice this exercise throughout the day.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Furthermore, another important aspect of this exercise is consistency. Try to see how often and how long you can maintain your attention on the right side of your vision for.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Not to mention, question why you think you&rsquo;ve been successful/unsuccessful in doing so.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Do you get distracted when you attempt to focus your attention on the right side of your vision? Do you find it hard placing your focus on anything at all?</Text>

<Text style={p}>Certainly, as with all awareness exercises, the more you practice them the better you&rsquo;ll become at training your mind to think in those terms.</Text>
