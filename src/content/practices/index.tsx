<Text style={p}>Learning to focus our attention is an important skill.</Text>

<Text style={p}>However, I would also argue that it&rsquo;s quite an advanced skill that should only be attempted once you feel more comfortable being aware in general.</Text>

<Text style={p}>In fact, it&rsquo;s an exercise which builds upon Observe Your Senses so it makes sense to master that first.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Otherwise, we can truly struggle with this exercise, and more often than not when people attempt to learn this exercise first, it almost always leads to more confusion than clarity.</Text>

<Text style={p}>So please do not proceed until you&rsquo;ve mastered more fundamental awareness exercises.</Text>

<View style={hr2}/>

<Text style={h2}>What is focus?</Text>

<View style={hr2__bottom}/>







<Text style={p}>The funny thing about focus is that it&rsquo;s a bit of a paradox, at least according to conventional wisdom.</Text>

<Text style={p}>A lot of people treat focus as if it&rsquo;s supposed to be this kind of intense period of concentration, which is designed to consume all you energy and attention.</Text>

<Text style={p}>In reality, effective focus is not like that and cannot come from tensing up and trying &lsquo;really hard&rsquo; to get into that mental zone.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>Instead, effective focus comes from being calm and relaxed with a clear intention in mind.</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>I mean, I&rsquo;m sure anyone could maintain intense focus by trying &lsquo;really hard&rsquo; however it certainly wouldn&rsquo;t be effective in the sense of being in control.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Ultimately, you cannot focus effectively if you&rsquo;re spending all your mental energy on creating an environment in which you feel comfortable to focus.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Because then you&rsquo;re left with significantly less energy to actually focus, and instead it leaves you incredibly vulnerable and quite ironically, without focus.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Definitely, not fun.</Text>

<Text style={p}>As stated earlier, if I had to describe what focus is.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>I would say that it's nothing more than awareness with a clear intention.</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>Which is to say that it&rsquo;s the same thing as being aware in the traditional sense (i.e. observation), only now you&rsquo;re choosing an intention outside of simply being aware of your senses.</Text>

<Text style={p}>This is why I say that you must first learn to master basic awareness before moving onto these kinds of exercises.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Because it actually requires more skill to remain calm and aware, while also selectively focusing on a certain aspect of your awareness.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Which people generally find more difficult than simply being aware of all their sense.</Text>

<Text style={p}>In essence, it&rsquo;s easier to be fully attuned to all your senses at once without focus, than it is to be fully attuned to just one of your senses</Text>

<Text style={p}>Simply because there&rsquo;s less overhead.</Text>

<View style={hr2}/>

<Text style={h2}>Instructions</Text>

<View style={hr2__bottom}/>







<Text style={p}>There are essentially two key steps towards performing this exercise.</Text>

<Text style={p}>First, relax and put yourself into a state of unconditional awareness, as per the instructions in Observe Your Senses.</Text>

<Text style={p}>In this state of mind, you should have completely emptied your mind and become fully attuned to your senses.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Then, once you have achieved this, attempt to place your attention on a very particular aspect of your awareness.</Text>

<Text style={p}>It could be something visual, like a lamp or a door. It could be a sound that is occurring in the background. It could be a physical sensation that you&rsquo;re experiencing in your body.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Play around with it and see where your mind takes you.</Text>

<Text style={p}>This is an exercise which porn addicts benefit from greatly, due to the way it changes your visual perception of reality.</Text>

<Text style={p}>So let&rsquo;s get crackin&rsquo;.</Text>

<Text style={p}>The intention behind a lot of these exercises is to assist you in breaking down what you understand of your mind.</Text>

<Text style={p}>The word &ldquo;understand&rdquo; of course, meaning the conglomerate of knowledge you&rsquo;ve gained and learned up until now.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Part of the reason why we want to break down your understanding of life and reality, is because what you currently &ldquo;know&rdquo; is largely counter-intuitive.</Text>

<View style={hr4}/>

<Text style={h4}>You see, what you "understand" is part of the reason why you're addicted to porn.</Text>

<View style={hr4__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>What you currently &ldquo;understand&rdquo; is that you really want to watch porn.</Text>

<Text style={p}>What you &ldquo;understand&rdquo; is that you don&rsquo;t have the self-control not to watch porn, and that it&rsquo;s a lot easier if you just relapse and watch porn.</Text>

<Text style={p}>And certainly, there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with that.</Text>

<Text style={p}>I mean, it&rsquo;s what you understand. You can&rsquo;t help what you&rsquo;ve been taught up until now, it&rsquo;s all your brain knows.</Text>

<Text style={p}>On the other hand, it&rsquo;s also perfectly fine to change your understanding of reality so that you can allow yourself the opportunity to overcome your own porn addiction.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Which is exactly what this website aims to do.</Text>

<Text style={p}>For today&rsquo;s exercise, what we want to do is break down our visual understanding of reality, and how that relates to our own thoughts and feelings.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Which is to say that we want to separate our thoughts and feelings from what we&rsquo;re actually seeing in front of us.</Text>

<View style={hr4}/>

<Text style={h4}>As human beings, we tend to attach meaning and value to that which we can physically see.</Text>

<View style={hr4__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>It could be a trinket that belongs to your family which evokes emotions of pride and belonging.</Text>

<Text style={p}>It could be the sight of a McDonalds in the distance, and the memories that place evokes. It could even be something more conceptual, like a particular scene within a movie.</Text>

<Text style={p}>And with this exercise we want to learn to separate these two elements, because what we see is not what we feel.</Text>

<Text style={p}>They are two completely separate elements which we&rsquo;ve learnt to associate together, no different to watching porn and all the feelings associated with it.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Both empowering and overwhelmingly negative.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Think of them as being two completely different sensations. The sensation of seeing, and the sensation of feeling.</Text>

<Text style={p}>So why is this important?</Text>

<Text style={p}>Well, let&rsquo;s look at porn addiction for example.</Text>

<Text style={p}>For porn addicts porn isn&rsquo;t just &ldquo;two people having sex&rdquo;. Rather, it&rsquo;s a complex relationship which evokes a whole range of feelings and emotions.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Porn is also feeling immense guilt for having relapsed, porn is feeling completely empty and drained on the inside, porn is the shame of lying about our habit to our friends and family.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Yet when you think about it, porn really is nothing more than &ldquo;two people having sex&rdquo;.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Sure, it&rsquo;s something that a lot of humans find destructively addictive, but it&rsquo;s hard to deny that from a visual perspective, there really is nothing that awful about it.</Text>

<Text style={p}>With this in mind, what this exercise attempts to do is help you come to the understand that porn is simply &ldquo;two people having sex&rdquo;.</Text>

<Text style={p}>And the way we do this is by separating what we feel and what we see into two different categories.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Because currently we may have developed a habit of jumbling the two together, and not quite realising all the steps our mind makes internal when jumping to the conclusion of &ldquo;I really want to watch porn&rdquo;.</Text>

<Text style={p}>One thing to notice is that this exercise may seem incredibly similar to Dissolve Your Visual Perception Of Reality.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Both exercises focus on manipulating our visual understanding in some way, however both exercises do completely different things.</Text>

<Text style={p}><Text style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>Dissolve Your Visual Perception Of Reality</Text> attempts to completely absolve our understanding of reality, while this exercise attempts to rearrange our understanding of it.</Text>

<View style={hr2}/>

<Text style={h2}>Instructions</Text>

<View style={hr2__bottom}/>







<Text style={p}>For this exercise, what we want to do is look at some things, and try and figure out the difference between what we&rsquo;re seeing and what we&rsquo;re feeling.</Text>

<Text style={p}>We can do this sitting down at home, or anywhere really. Observe what you see. Observe what you feel.</Text>

<Text style={p}>It could be a building. It could be another person. I tend to do this exercise using everyday objects, although sentimental objects can work well too.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Especially objects that we&rsquo;ve kept around the house for a while, that you&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time with. (for example, it could be a video game console)</Text>

<Text style={p}>Can you distinguish any difference between the object and the feeling? What are those differences? Is there even a difference?</Text>

<Text style={p}>Is there any feeling at all, and are you responsible for creating that feeling or is it the object which is responsible for how you feel</Text>

<Text style={p}>Play around with it.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Try this exercises in different areas and different places. See if you can discover any common themes.</Text>

<Text style={p}>The world truly is your oyster ^^</Text>





      </ContentContainer>
    </ScrollView>
  );
}

export const SlowDownTime = ({ componentId }: any) => {
  return (
    <ScrollView>
      <ContentContainer>
        <Text style={content__title}>Slow Down Time</Text>
        <Text style={content__date}>2019-01-18</Text>
        

<Text style={p}>This exercise is one of the easiest ways to start building your awareness.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>Essentially, it involves slowing down your mind so that you can open yourself to the opportunity of being aware.</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>One of the most common ways we weaken our ability to be aware is by losing control over our thoughts.</Text>

<Text style={p}>And the reason why we lose control over our thoughts is because they can be almost impossible to track when they&rsquo;re zooming around in our head at a million miles per hour.</Text>

<Text style={p}>In other words, because we&rsquo;re overthinking.</Text>

<Text style={p}>In most cases we don&rsquo;t even realise we&rsquo;re overthinking, because we&rsquo;re so consumed by our thoughts that we don&rsquo;t even allow ourselves the opportunity to realise what&rsquo;s going on.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Which over time can form into an instinctual reaction towards dealing with our negative feelings and emotions.</Text>

<View style={hr2}/>

<Text style={h2}>Certainly, for most people, porn addiction is merely a subconscious response.</Text>

<View style={hr2__bottom}/>







<Text style={p}>And this exercise is designed to help break that cycle.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Rather than attempt to identify and qualify these thoughts, what we&rsquo;re going to do is simply going to focus on the raw process and sensation of thinking.</Text>

<Text style={p}>And in doing so, embrace the physical sensation of what it actually feels like to be in control of our minds, in order to create a strong foundation for being able to control what we think and feel.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>Because when we're in control of our mind, it's almost as if everything is moving in slow motion.</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>The key thing to understand about maintaining control over our minds is that isn&rsquo;t necessarily about being able to react to what&rsquo;s in front of us.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Instead, a large part of maintaining control is about being able to prepare ourselves mentally for the events that will take place in the future.</Text>

<Text style={p}>The idea being that we can then catch ourselves before we begin overthinking, and identify these patterns before they become unmanagable.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Because when our mind is racing at a million miles per hour, it can become incredibly difficult, if not impossible to slow it down.</Text>

<View style={hr4}/>

<Text style={h4}>Which is why people inevitably relapse.</Text>

<View style={hr4__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>Because at that point, you&rsquo;ve already lost control.</Text>

<Text style={p}>By practicing <Text style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>Slow it down</Text> you will learn how to slow down your mind on a regular basis.</Text>

<Text style={p}>In order to demonstrate control, and create those neural connections in your brain.</Text>

<Text style={p}>In addition, it will help you understand how to become a more calm and collected person, exposing in the process the futility and self-destructiveness of letting our thoughts control us.</Text>

<View style={hr2}/>

<Text style={h2}>Instructions</Text>

<View style={hr2__bottom}/>







<Text style={p}>When you have a moment, just slow down your mind.</Text>

<Text style={p}>This tends to work best when you&rsquo;re in the middle of doing something, because that&rsquo;s usually when your mind is engaged and requires relaxation.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Keep in mind that there are two different aspects to this exercise:
Mental and physical.</Text>

<Text style={p}>For example, when I&rsquo;m walking down the street, aside from slowing down my thoughts, I will also sometimes physically slow down, even stopping where I stand.</Text>

<Text style={p}>The idea is to prove control over yourself, even when you have other intentions, such as getting to a destination on time.</Text>

<Text style={p}>An idea that will prove very important in following exercises.</Text>





      </ContentContainer>

export const StopAbsolutelyEverythingYoureDoing = ({ componentId }: any) => {

        <Text style={content__date}>2019-01-22</Text>
        



<Text style={p}>I love this exercise.</Text>

<Text style={p}>I can&rsquo;t quite tell if this exercise is an analogue to Slow Down Your Perception Of Time or a percursor to it, however they&rsquo;re both different approaches to the same concept of awareness.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Usually you&rsquo;ll end up using both in conjunction, but it&rsquo;s arguably easier to learn them as separate, unique skills.</Text>

<Text style={p}>All awareness exercises essentially come down to finding different ways to break down you perception of who you are.</Text>

<Text style={p}>And this is a very important practice because our perception of who we are, isn&rsquo;t actually who we are.</Text>

<Text style={p}>It is merely an identity we carry to help us navigate through life.</Text>

<Text style={p}>And when we don&rsquo;t realise this, or aren&rsquo;t consciously aware of this label that we prescribe to ourselves on a daily basis, then we can become ransom to this persona.</Text>

<Text style={p}>By learning to understand this identity, we provide ourselves with the opportunity to be able to directly control how we operate, without relying on the expectations of this persona.</Text>

<View style={hr4}/>

<Text style={h4}>What this exercise attempts to do is help you better disassociate yourself from this persona.</Text>

<View style={hr4__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>The end goal isn&rsquo;t necessarily to completely dissolve this persona.</Text>

<Text style={p}>(Not that there&rsquo;s anything wrong with dissolving it. It&rsquo;s simply impractical for most people, including myself)</Text>

<Text style={p}>However to have the capacity to be able to dissolve it at will, as well keep on top of it when it may be beginning to get out of hand is a wonderful skill to have.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Essentially, what this exercise teaches you is to learn to let go from a physical perspective in the sense of stopping your mind altogether.</Text>

<Text style={p}>I think you&rsquo;ll have fun with this one.</Text>

<View style={hr2}/>

<Text style={h2}>Instructions</Text>

<View style={hr2__bottom}/>







<Text style={p}>This exercise generally only works while you&rsquo;re doing something.</Text>

<Text style={p}>You could be studying. You could be walking down the street in an attempt to get somewhere. Definitely don&rsquo;t do it mid-conversation.</Text>

<Text style={p}>However during that activity, what you want to do is turn off your mind completely.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Like, just shut it off.</Text>

<Text style={p}>It can help to pretend as if you&rsquo;re a robot that&rsquo;s just had it&rsquo;s power supply cut off.</Text>

<Text style={p}>One thing to keep in mind is that it&rsquo;s an exercice that&rsquo;s largely conceptual and based on feeling.</Text>

<Text style={p}>So really play around with the character and explore this idea of what it means to shut down like a robot on it&rsquo;s last legs.</Text>

<Text style={p}>What does shutting down entail? Are there any steps towards shutting down, or is it an instantaneous action?</Text>

<Text style={p}>What does it feel like to be shut down? Can you feel at all once you&rsquo;ve shut down?</Text>

<Text style={p}>When you&rsquo;ve shut down do you feel relaxed or tense? Is this a reflection on your own ability to relax at will?</Text>

<Text style={p}>Play with it and see where it takes you.</Text>

<Text style={p}>&hellip;and obviously don&rsquo;t do this while crossing a road.</Text>

        <Text style={content__date}>2019-01-27</Text>
        



<Text style={p}>This exercise encompasses one of the most fundamental skills in regards to practicing meditation.</Text>

<View style={hr4}/>

<Text style={h4}>Your ability to remain aware of your senses in the present moment.</Text>

<View style={hr4__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>It&rsquo;s a skill which will form the foundation of almost all the practices on this website, in particular the introspection aspect of these practices i.e. how these exercises make you feel as you practice them.</Text>

<Text style={p}>The interesting thing about this exercise is that despite the inherent simplicity of what it is, it&rsquo;s an exercise most people struggle with.</Text>

<Text style={p}>In part, because of the great amount of misunderstanding and confusion surrounding what &lsquo;observation&rsquo; truly is.</Text>

<Text style={p}>And this happens for a number of reasons.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>For starters, we severely overcomplicate what it is, thinking it must be so much more than simply paying attention to what we're feeling.</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>Instead, we develop this idea that it must be this highly-trained skill that only Bhuddist monks can attain following years of practice in a remote location.</Text>

<Text style={p}>So what ends up happening is put all this effort and strain into trying to develop this &lsquo;zen-like&rsquo; state of mind, which ends up exhausting us more than it does helping us.</Text>

<Text style={p}>We become so distracted in the expectation of what observation should be, that we ironically spend all our mental effort judging and feeling pressured, rather than observing at all.</Text>

<Text style={p}>So let&rsquo;s change that.</Text>

<Text style={p}>To put it into the most simple terms I know how.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>Observation is nothing more than paying attention to your senses.</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>If you&rsquo;re at a cafe for example, it means paying attention to the sounds of the people chatting around you, what the atmosphere around you smells like etc.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Because when you think about it, you&rsquo;re already observing reality.</Text>

<Text style={p}>You&rsquo;re already breathing. You&rsquo;re already blinking. You&rsquo;re already seeing.</Text>

<Text style={p}>You simply haven&rsquo;t applied that extra step of making yourself aware of all those things which you are currently doing.</Text>

<Text style={p}>It&rsquo;s literally that simple.</Text>

<Text style={p}>You don&rsquo;t need to attempt to find something that&rsquo;s not there, nor even manipulate your interpretation of what you&rsquo;re feeling or thinking via thought or judgement.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Instead, it&rsquo;s about noticing your surroundings, thoughts and feelings, in addition to any particular reactions you may be having to those aspects of your reality. Hell, perhaps you&rsquo;re not even thinking or feeling at all?</Text>

<Text style={p}>That&rsquo;s for you to discover.</Text>

<View style={hr4}/>

<Text style={h4}>Where I personally feel a lot of people explaining observation go wrong, is that they focus on this whole "really try to empty your thoughts" or "attempt to refrain from judgement" mindset.</Text>

<View style={hr4__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>Because it essentially implies that you have to do &ldquo;more&rdquo; to somehow achieve what is effectively an empty state of mind.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Which doesn&rsquo;t make any sense, and is even contradictory.</Text>

<Text style={p}>You don&rsquo;t have to change anything. Observation isn&rsquo;t about changing anything or setting expectations. It&rsquo;s the exact opposite of that.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Instead, it&rsquo;s about observing what you&rsquo;re currently sensing via your thoughts and emotions.</Text>

<Text style={p}>So don&rsquo;t worry about trying to prevent your thoughts, or getting frustrating if you can&rsquo;t stop thinking.</Text>

<Text style={p}>That&rsquo;s precisely the problem we&rsquo;re trying to address, and the way we do that is by focusing on the task at hand, which is observation itself.</Text>

<View style={hr4}/>

<Text style={h4}>Another important thing to keep in mind is that we're not necessarily attempting to 'achieve' anything with observation.</Text>

<View style={hr4__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>Instead, what we&rsquo;re doing is exploring.</Text>

<Text style={p}>We&rsquo;re exploring how we feel, how we think, as well as discovering what we personally find enjoyable and empowering.</Text>

<Text style={p}>So that we can better understand ourselves.</Text>

<View style={hr2}/>

<Text style={h2}>Instructions</Text>

<View style={hr2__bottom}/>







<Text style={p}>This exercise is outrageously simple.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Observe your senses.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Observe what you&rsquo;re feeling. Observe what you&rsquo;re thinking. Observe what&rsquo;s around you.</Text>

<Text style={p}>The world is your oyster.</Text>

<View style={hr4}/>

<Text style={h4}>Observe all the various interactions that are taking place in your mind.</Text>

<View style={hr4__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>It&rsquo;s about sitting there (or standing, or walking, or whatever you happen to be doing) and paying attention to what you&rsquo;re sensing, whether it be thought, emotion or absolutely nothing at all.</Text>

<Text style={p}>And remember, you&rsquo;re not attempting to change anything here. Instead you&rsquo;re merely keeping note and acknowledging the cloud of sensation that is your reality.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Certainly, you may struggle with it initially.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Which is to say that you may not be used to simply observing, and instead be in a constant state of reaction and judgement.</Text>

<Text style={p}>That&rsquo;s okay too. It&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re practicing this exercise, so we can improve and develop these skills.</Text>

<Text style={p}>So don&rsquo;t be alarmed if you find observation to be difficult.</Text>

<Text style={p}>There&rsquo;s always a first for everything.</Text>

<Text style={p}>This exercise is designed to help dissolve your ego.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>In particular, by getting you actively reinterpret your visual field.</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>Before we commence however, we must first come to understand how humans interpret reality.</Text>

<Text style={p}>On a conceptual level, humans relate to the world with language. We use words and symbols in order to define and describe the world around us.</Text>

<Text style={p}>It&rsquo;s what allows us to gauge social situations, learn new theoretical concepts and better understand the relationship between ourselves and our environment.</Text>

<Text style={p}>And yet, although we live in this predefined world of assumptions based on our conceptual understanding of the world.</Text>

<Text style={p}>None of it is actually &lsquo;real&rsquo;.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>Numbers, for example, are not real. They're just mathematical descriptions.</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>On a cultural level, this conceptuality extends to all the predefined rules we have in regards to how we should act and behave.</Text>

<Text style={p}>For example, some cultures prefer kissing as opposed to shaking hands as a way to greet others &hellip;and yet this preference doesn&rsquo;t actually help describe what humans are.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Although society attempts to define us based on our behaviours and how we act, it still doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that we all have five fingers, two eyes and need to be loved.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>We're all still merely people, after all.</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>By the same token, our addiction to porn maintains a very similar same layer of conceptual &lsquo;description&rsquo; which prevents us from truly seeing what we&rsquo;re actually doing.</Text>

<Text style={p}>For example, we can find ourselves drawn to certain types of porn or online fetishes.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Even though, when you think about it, it&rsquo;s all just a bunch of light emanating from our computer screens.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Which when you put it like that, makes porn addiction seem quite silly.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>I mean, is that arrangement of light and colour on your computer screen really that special enough for you to be completely dependent upon it?</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>Essentially, what we intend to do with this exercise is help your brain distinguish between what you see (i.e. light and colour).</Text>

<Text style={p}>In contrast to that extra layer of conceptuality clouding your vision (i.e. the actual person standing in front of you).</Text>

<Text style={p}>We want to remove this bias from our visual understanding of reality, not only to see a &lsquo;clearer&rsquo; picture of reality, but to better understand what we&rsquo;re actually experiencing.</Text>

<Text style={p}>So really, what we&rsquo;re trying to discover is.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>What information do we lose with all this additional mental processing?</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>Can we call what we even see with this additional processing &lsquo;reality&rsquo;?</Text>

<Text style={p}>Is it possible to truly &lsquo;see&rsquo; when our minds are in a constant state of evaluation?</Text>

<Text style={p}>These are the questions will be attempting to answer and of course, it can help to understand that there are many ways we cloud our vision with description.</Text>

<Text style={p}>For example, we typically use a variety of objects in our visual field to construct depth. Then, we often evaluate those objects. Are they alive? Are they human? Are they dangerous?</Text>

<Text style={p}>Ultimately, this is the process we are trying to understand.</Text>

<View style={hr2}/>

<Text style={h2}>Instructions</Text>

<View style={hr2__bottom}/>







<Text style={p}>For this exercise, what we want to do is attempt to treat our visual field as a simple plane of a light and colour.</Text>

<Text style={p}>No objects. No descriptions. No focusing on certain details over another. No intepretations.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Nuthin&rsquo;.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Instead, what we want to do is treat our visual field as a non-descript arrangement of light and colour.</Text>

<Text style={p}>It usually helps to imagine everything as a cloud of sensation, although I&rsquo;m sure there are other more meaningful ways to describe it.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Certainly, don&rsquo;t try to focus.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Keep your attention wide and merely feel as if you&rsquo;re intaking the visual information around you, rather than from the point of view of you actively perceiving that information.</Text>

<Text style={p}>While you can do this anywhere, I personally find it works best when I have a few minutes alone, where you can really explore this idea uninterupted.</Text>

<Text style={p}>This exercise is incredibly effective, especially for those new to awareness.</Text>

<Text style={p}>I mean, I&rsquo;d go as far as to say that all exercises are effective. It&rsquo;s just that some exercises a lot simpler to execute than others.</Text>

<Text style={p}>One thing you&rsquo;ll notice as you trawl this website, is that there are a range of different exercises which all seem quite similar to each other.</Text>

<Text style={p}>This includes Slow Down Time where we attempt to slow down and speed up reality, as well as Stop Absolutely Everything You&rsquo;re Doing where we attempt to shut down our mind completely, as if we&rsquo;ve consciously flicked off a switch at the back of our minds.</Text>

<Text style={p}>The idea is that with different perspectives, we can learn to understand ourselves and our conscious experience with a more open mind, as well as embrace different ways of thinking.</Text>

<Text style={p}>So that we can effectively challenge the denial that comes with being an addict.</Text>

<Text style={p}>With <Text style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>Relax Everything</Text>, what we&rsquo;re essentially trying to do is learn to relax and let go, as opposed to say, consciously manipulate our interpretation of reality or make judgements about how we&rsquo;re feeling.</Text>

<Text style={p}>It&rsquo;s a skill which will allow us to effectively deal with our urges and uncomfortable feelings and emotions.</Text>

<Text style={p}>An important thing to keep in mind with these awareness exercises is that while we&rsquo;re ultimately aiming to develop hard skills, it&rsquo;s also important for us to focus on the introspection aspect of these exercises as well.</Text>

<Text style={p}>In other words, how these different exercises make us feel as we practice them.</Text>

<Text style={p}>From an introspection point of view, we&rsquo;re not necessarily trying to &lsquo;achieve&rsquo; anything per-say.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Instead, what we&rsquo;re merely attempting to do is observe and develop our ability to view ourselves with a more open mind.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Essentially, it&rsquo;s a very effective way to learn mastery over your thoughts and emotions.</Text>

<Text style={p}>So whenever you&rsquo;re doing these kinds of exercises, remember to always try and guage how you feel. Does the exercise make you feel frustrated? Do you think anything at all?</Text>

<View style={hr4}/>

<Text style={h4}>If you skip this step, then you'll gain very little from these exercises because you won't be actively engaging your brain.</Text>

<View style={hr4__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>And if you don&rsquo;t engage your brain, then you won&rsquo;t engage in physical changes that take place between your neural connections, and subscequently you won&rsquo;t be truly changing in the sense of conscious realisation.</Text>

<Text style={p}>So ask yourself when doing the exercise:</Text>

<Text style={p}>Do you feel more comfortable when you relax? Is there anything you don&rsquo;t like about relaxing? How does it compare to other awareness exercises? Do you even understand what it means to be relaxed at all?</Text>

<Text style={p}>Remember, this is a process of self-discovery.</Text>

<Text style={p}>There are no right or wrong answers.</Text>

<Text style={p}>There is only what you feel and how you perceive.</Text>

<View style={hr2}/>

<Text style={h2}>Instructions</Text>

<View style={hr2__bottom}/>







<Text style={p}>For this exercise, what we want to do is relax and you can do this whenever you want.</Text>

<Text style={p}>I personally find it&rsquo;s quite effective to engage in this activity while doing something, because it&rsquo;s arguably easier to relax when you&rsquo;re in a non-relaxed state, as opposed to sitting silently in a chair.</Text>

<Text style={p}>So what does it mean to relax?</Text>

<Text style={p}>Well, let&rsquo;s start with some of the physical attributes.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Relaxing from a physical perspective means letting go of all the tension in your body. It means slowing your mental pace, as well as taking things easy.</Text>

<Text style={p}>If I had to describe the essence of relaxation, I would say that it&rsquo;s about experiencing life without obligation or care. You just are.</Text>

<Text style={p}>It means not worrying about anything, because you know what? There&rsquo;s simply no obligation to worry, because when you are relaxed you have no responsibilty to anything.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Again, I urge you to remember that this is a process of self-discovery, and that I&rsquo;m not asking you to permanently dissolve into a puddle of jelly.</Text>

<Text style={p}>These are short bursts of perspective I am asking you to engage in throughout the day, in order to develop a more open mind.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Certainly, while I can describe what relaxation is all day, unless if you actually attempt to practice it, then you simply won&rsquo;t learn what it actually is, nor be able to effectively use it when required.</Text>

<Text style={p}>One key thing to understand about relaxation is that it&rsquo;s a feeling, so if you can&rsquo;t feel it on demand, then you won&rsquo;t be able to cope when you find yourself in a situation where you feel compelled to watch porn or do something equally self-destructive.</Text>

<Text style={p}>In other words, relaxation is one of the many health coping mechanisms we will be developing in order to help us cope with life in a more effective way.</Text>

        <Text style={content__date}>2019-02-28</Text>
        

<Text style={p}>A lot of people find this exercise super useful, because it can help us identify our biases much easier than trying to identify those biases directly.</Text>

<Text style={p}>It&rsquo;s a great thinking exercise, which makes you realise how well optimised our minds truly are when it comes to filtering information.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Judgement by function is conditional.</Text>

<Text style={p}>We discover some sort of condition which triggers us to react, either negatively or positively.</Text>

<Text style={p}>For a lot of people, these triggers are aspects of their personality they&rsquo;re completely unaware of.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Most judgemental people don&rsquo;t even realise they&rsquo;re judgemental, because it&rsquo;s such an ingrained aspect of who they are, that they assume it&rsquo;s all just some continuum of everyday thought.</Text>

<Text style={p}>In these situations, it can be very difficult to actually identify what is judgement and what is not.</Text>

<Text style={p}>And so the purpose of this exercise is to help you make that distinction, by bringing to your attention the things which you don&rsquo;t feel compelled to be judgemental about.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Which for a lot people, is a lot simpler than trying to identify the things which they feel passionately judgemental about.</Text>

<Text style={p}>In addition, it can help them understand more about themselves, by merely identifying the things which they don&rsquo;t care about.</Text>

<View style={hr2}/>

<Text style={h2}>Instructions</Text>

<View style={hr2__bottom}/>







<Text style={p}>The exercise is simple.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Your task is to think about the things you don&rsquo;t feel judgemental about.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Things which you couldn&rsquo;t possibly care about, which don&rsquo;t evoke any kind of reaction.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Then once you&rsquo;ve identified that thing, ask yourself why? Why doesn&rsquo;t that particular subject evoke a feeling?</Text>

<Text style={p}>Why are you not attached to that particular subject?</Text>

<Text style={p}>For example, I&rsquo;m not judgemental about medical surgeons. I have literally zero opinion on medical surgeons.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Why? Well, I guess because I don&rsquo;t actually know any medical surgeons, and it&rsquo;s simply not a subject which ever enters my conscious.</Text>

<Text style={p}>The key with this exercise is to progressively try to find subjects which you&rsquo;re not judgemental about, yet may be related to or have something in common with the things you are judgemental about.</Text>

<Text style={p}>For example, you may feel judgemental about celebrities or politicians, but feel significantly less judgement about popular sporting figures.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Try and discover some common themes. Perhaps you might discover something. Perhaps you might not.</Text>

<Text style={p}>We&rsquo;re all here to learn more about how our individual minds work.</Text>

        <Text style={content__date}>2019-03-12</Text>
        

<Text style={p}>This exercise is designed to help you keep on top of your awareness throughout the day.</Text>

<Text style={p}>By becoming more conscious of the events throughout our day, we can become more conscious of the things we do within it.</Text>

<Text style={p}>With this exercise, what we&rsquo;re attempting to do is become conscious of key moments throughout our day.</Text>

<View style={hrul}/>

<View style={ul}>
<Text style={li}><Text style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>When we wake up.</Text></Text>
<Text style={li}><Text style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>When we shower.</Text></Text>
<Text style={li}><Text style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>When we travel to work.</Text></Text>
<Text style={li}><Text style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>During our lunch break.</Text></Text>
<Text style={li}><Text style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>At dinner.</Text></Text>
<Text style={li}><Text style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>Before bed.</Text></Text>
</View>

<View style={hrul__bottom}/>

<Text style={p}>The key thing to understand about awareness is that we&rsquo;re not actually aware unless if we exercise it.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Largely, most of us do all of the things mentioned above, without truly being aware that they&rsquo;re actually happening.</Text>

<Text style={p}>I mean, how many times have you consciously thought about something from the very moment you&rsquo;ve woken up?</Text>

<Text style={p}>You know, about a giraffe or that you&rsquo;re well and alive with two wonderful eyes?</Text>

<Text style={p}>Chances are those thoughts have simply never occurred to you, because instead, you go into autopilot mode where you just follow the motions.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>For this exercise, we want to do is start engaging our brain so that we can have those thoughts at these key moments throughout the day.</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>The idea is that once we become more conscious of what&rsquo;s happening throughout our day, it can become a lot easier to detect and stop negative habits from reoccurring.</Text>

<Text style={p}>In particular, to better address our cravings, as well as those moments associated to our addiction where we feel as if we are not in control.</Text>

<Text style={p}>And despite this exercise being relatively straight forward, it&rsquo;s an exercise that a lot of people struggle with, because it&rsquo;s a completely different way of engaging with the world.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Becoming aware is not easy when you haven&rsquo;t consciously made an effort in the past to be aware before.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Of course, practice makes perfect.</Text>

<View style={hr2}/>

<Text style={h2}>Instructions</Text>

<View style={hr2__bottom}/>







<Text style={p}>Essentially this is an exercise of acknowledgement.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Throughout your day, simply acknowledge what&rsquo;s taking place at that time.</Text>

<Text style={p}>For more specificity, you can identify the location, time and what exactly you&rsquo;re doing.</Text>

<Text style={p}>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s 7am and I&rsquo;m currently brushing my teeth in the bathroom.&rdquo;</Text>

<Text style={p}>At this point, I want you to focus on how you feel.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Are you feeling tired? Are you feeling neutral? Are you feeling angry?</Text>

<Text style={p}>Regardless of how you feel, the idea is to get you to think about these events and how they relate to your emotions.</Text>

<Text style={p}>The other reason behind doing this, is that by identifying how you feel, it actually allows you to dissociate from your emotions and not take them personally.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Of course, you don&rsquo;t need to think about. It simply comes naturally.</Text>

<Text style={p}>The end goal here, aside from engaging your awareness, is to acknowledge and not react emotionally.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Because the more you do this, the more you know ahead of time how you will feel, and progressively overtime you will simply feel neutral at these particular time triggers throughout your day.</Text>

<Text style={p}>This is a truly fantastic exercise that I do everyday and it serves as an amazing anchor for my emotions.</Text>

<Text style={p}>You engage your awareness from the very moment you wake up, and it just gives you such a strong foothold over how you feel throughout the day.</Text>

        <Text style={content__date}>2019-03-18</Text>
        <Text style={p}>This exercise can be inherently difficult.</Text>

<Text style={p}>In large part because it demands you to think consciously beyond which you may feel comfortable.</Text>

<Text style={p}>In fact, half the reason why you&rsquo;re addicted to porn is because of all the subconscious behaviours you&rsquo;ve been constructing over the years, in order to deal with your own feelings of inadequacy etc.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Which meant putting your conscious awareness aside, which has now grown weak and must be retrained again from scratch.</Text>

<Text style={p}>With this exercise what we&rsquo;re going to attempt to do is to try and understand what it&rsquo;s like to be in the shoes of others.</Text>

<Text style={p}>And this kind of empathy is most prominent when we&rsquo;re watching documentaries based on humanitarian crisis or exploitation, where we get to see people struggle first-hand.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Certainly part of the reason why this is easy, as opposed to what you&rsquo;ll be attempting to do, is because you get to hear the stories of those people first-hand.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Instead of these people however, I want you to try and understand the people around you, whether that be your own friends and family, or even random strangers in public.</Text>

<Text style={p}>At the very least, to observe your own feelings of how you perceive others.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Now, although this may seem like an opportunity to judge, mock and possibly even condemn others, this truly isn&rsquo;t the purpose of the exercise.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Essentially, it comes down to two different thing:</Text>

<Text style={p}><Text style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>How you genuinely feel about others from their own individual point of view.</Text></Text>

<Text style={p}><Text style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>Observing and questioning the validity of those feelings.</Text></Text>

<Text style={p}>And the benefits of this exercise are numerous.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Most prominently, attempting to try and understand others is an excellent way to uncover the extent to which we misunderstand ourselves.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Because if you&rsquo;re feeling particularly negative about someone (or possibly positive) then that usually reflects in how we see ourselves.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Which is to say that our empathy is often a reflection of our ability to judge and self-criticise.</Text>

<View style={hr2}/>

<Text style={h2}>Instructions</Text>

<View style={hr2__bottom}/>







<Text style={p}>For this exercise what we want to do is try and imagine what it&rsquo;s like to be others from their point of view.</Text>

<Text style={p}>This exercise works best when you&rsquo;re in public, usually sitting on public transport where you and the other person are both present.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Obviously, don&rsquo;t go crazy and stare at the other person, but I&rsquo;m sure you get the idea.</Text>

<Text style={p}>What can really help with this exercise is to first put all of your feelings and emotions aside, and just imagine a neutral version of yourself.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Then with this neutral version, imagine the other person being the same as well.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Starting with this blank slate can help immensely, because there&rsquo;s no point jumping to conclusions straight away.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Then once you&rsquo;re in that neutral mindset, you can begin to observe.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Does the other person look tense, or perhaps is it you who&rsquo;s actually tense?</Text>

<Text style={p}>Are they happy, sad or entirely neutral? Does it look like their mind is pre-occupied? How can you possibly know?</Text>

<Text style={p}>How do you personally feel doing this exercise? Do you find it difficult or easy?</Text>

<Text style={p}>In addition, also realise the extent to which you simply cannot be empathetic.</Text>

<Text style={p}>What aspects of a person can you not feel? Is it because they&rsquo;re aspects which you struggle to feel yourself?</Text>

<Text style={p}>Certainly, you may be surprised with what you discover.</Text>

        <Text style={content__date}>2019-03-22</Text>
        <Text style={p}>This exercise is a great way to force yourself out of your comfort zone.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Essentially, the idea behind this exercise is to force limitation upon ourselves and gauge not only how we respond, but how we can better react inspite of our circumstances.</Text>

<Text style={p}>As I&rsquo;ve written about extensively, part of what makes NeverFap Deluxe effective is learning to respond effectively in the face of adversity.</Text>

<Text style={p}>It can be easy to get frustrated when we&rsquo;re forced to slow down, or even do something which we&rsquo;re entirely unfamiliar with, but the key thing to understand here is that when we do get frustrated we&rsquo;re essentially fighting with ourselves.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Which is to say that these &ldquo;limitations&rdquo; are merely perceptions or expectations we have based in the belief that we deserve better.</Text>

<Text style={p}>It&rsquo;s important that we learn to dissolve these expectations in order to learn to live without these self-percieved limitations.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Not only because they&rsquo;re not real, but also because they truly hinder us in the sense that they do not empower us in any way.</Text>

<Text style={p}>What happens if we get hit by a car and we&rsquo;re no longer able to walk again? What if something does truly happen to our dominant hand and we&rsquo;re no longer able to use it?</Text>

<Text style={p}>This also extends to situations in life which are simply out of our control. It could be the death of a family member. It could be the loss of your job.</Text>

<Text style={p}>And things which due to our beliefs, can cause us to derail and end in self-harm if we choose to react inappropriately i.e. masturbate to porn.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Rather, what&rsquo;s important is that we learn to remain calm and relaxed inspite of what we&rsquo;re experiencing, both with and without limitations.</Text>

<Text style={p}>In other words, this exercise can be thought of as a test to train us to deal with difficult situations.</Text>

<Text style={p}>As well as help us better appreciate the difficulty of unfamiliarity of being limited in some way, not as an obstacle, but as an opportunity to learn, develop and grow as individuals.</Text>

<View style={hr2}/>

<Text style={h2}>Instructions</Text>

<View style={hr2__bottom}/>







<Text style={p}>For this exercise what we essentially want to do is utilise our less-dominant hand to complete everyday tasks.</Text>

<Text style={p}>It could be brushing your teeth. It could be washing the dishes. It could be writing. It could be using your phone.</Text>

<Text style={p}>It could be any number of things and I want you to take note of a few things which will help you get the most out of this exercise.</Text>

<Text style={p}>For starters, I want you to notice the physical feeling of using your non-dominant hand. What does it feel like to use your other hand in ways you&rsquo;ve probably never used before?</Text>

<Text style={p}>Does it feel unnatural? Does it feel slightly unreal? Is the task just as easy to complete with your non-dominant hand? In what ways does it feel similar? It what ways do you have less control?</Text>

<Text style={p}>Next, I want you to focus on how it makes you feel emotionally.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Do you feel any less capable as a human being? Does it make you feel &ldquo;stuck&rdquo;? Does it make you feel graitude or frustration? Do you feel as if you want to blame yourself?</Text>

<Text style={p}>As always, there are no right or wrong answers when practicing these kinds of exercises. These exercises are merely designed to gauge your response in regards to a complete change of pace.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Ultimately, it&rsquo;s up to you how you choose to respond.</Text>

<Text style={p}>They exist to help you become aware of your thoughts, actions and behaviours, so you can decide to consciously change or replace them if you so desire.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Otherwise, nothing will change and you will continue to repeat the same behaviours time and time again.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Open your mind and the rest will follow.</Text>

        <Text style={p}><b>Where Do You Touch?</b> is another classic awareness exercise which is designed to help you develop focus and attention.</Text>

<Text style={p}>By &ldquo;classic&rdquo; I mean it&rsquo;s another variation of the tried-and-true &ldquo;pay attention to X thing throughout the day&rdquo; that I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve seen in abundance on this website.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Well, the reason why I write so many of them is because they&rsquo;re incredibly effective at getting you to think about awareness in a unique way.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>In essence, because this is what you should be doing with your attention anyway.</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>Which is to say that you should be practicing awareness in everything you do, and that this exercise is merely a shortcut to having you eventually do this automatically.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Awareness is important because it&rsquo;s what allows you to understand and learn your own behaviours, not only to change them, but also to enhance them.</Text>

<Text style={p}>By practicing awareness in any capacity, we train our ability to catch ourselves doing silly things, like watching porn when we&rsquo;re feeling stressed.</Text>

<Text style={p}>And instead, consciously decide within that moment, to replace that unhealthy coping mechanism with a healthy coping mechanism instead.</Text>

<Text style={p}>The more we practice this, the more it will help us to think in terms of using our awareness in an empowering way, and eventually it will become second-nature to us.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Overtime we will become more aware of all our behaviours and quirks, and this is when we will develop full-control over our lives.</Text>

<View style={hr2}/>

<Text style={h2}>Instructions</Text>

<View style={hr2__bottom}/>







<Text style={p}>In this exercise we&rsquo;re going to be paying attention to our body and how it interacts with touch.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Essentially, I want you to take note of whenever you&rsquo;re touching something.</Text>

<Text style={p}>For example, I&rsquo;m currently using my fingers to tap against this keyboard in order to type these words.</Text>

<Text style={p}>And yet although it&rsquo;s something I spend most my day doing, it&rsquo;s not something I&rsquo;ve ever really thought about.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Well, that&rsquo;s precisely the problem we&rsquo;re trying to address. To begin thinking about behaviours which your brain has subconsciously ignored for decades.</Text>

<Text style={p}>For example, your response to masturbate daily as a way to deal with certain feelings and emotions.</Text>

<Text style={p}>In addition, an important aspect of this exercise is to pay attention to the feeling of touch as well.</Text>

<Text style={p}>What does it feel like when you bump into something? Does it hurt when you touch something? Does it feel hot or cold? Does it evoke emotion?</Text>

<Text style={p}>Only by becoming aware of our senses can we not only learn to better understand how they relate to our conscious experience.</Text>

<Text style={p}>However it can help us to better control the experience itself once we become aware of our behaviours related to touch.</Text>

<Text style={p}>This is a great exercise in terms of being able to understand what it means to truly focus our minds and train our attention.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Part of the reason why many of us struggle with this idea of focus, is because many of us have this very rigid understanding of what focus is, as a &ldquo;hardcore&rdquo; state of mind that is attained in a very specific way.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Usually via intense meditation and awareness study, as well as an almost exquiste sense of self-control over our minds.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Well, I&rsquo;m here to tell you that it&rsquo;s quite the opposite.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>In actual fact, focus and attention are largely conceptual ideas which have no rigid implementation.</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>Which is to say that there is no one, nor necessarily correct way to obtain focus. And that all the limitations we perceive about our own ability to focus, are purely self-made.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Certainly, this isn&rsquo;t to say that you may not be struggling with developing focus.</Text>

<Text style={p}>However, it merely indicates that the perceived limitations we have in regards to our inability to focus can be solved with a simple change of mind.</Text>

<Text style={p}>And the way we are going to do this is by playing around with our focus and attention in a unique way.</Text>

<Text style={p}>I would definitely describe it as a fun exercise, which ultimately has you utilising your imagination in order to practice the unlimited number of ways we can develop and utilise focus.</Text>

<Text style={p}>It will also help introduce you to a way of thinking which has unique applications when it comes to learning, if you so choose to use it.</Text>

<View style={hr2}/>

<Text style={h2}>Instructions</Text>

<View style={hr2__bottom}/>







<Text style={p}>In order to practice this exercise, you&rsquo;ll first need to pay attention to your surroundings.</Text>

<Text style={p}>For starters, attempt to take note of the various objects within your surrounding area.</Text>

<Text style={p}>It could be a door. It could be a lamp on your desk. Perhaps even a plant or tree outside.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Now, with this information in mind I want you to place your focus and attention onto one of these objects.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Noticing this object, I want you to really take note of it&rsquo;s shape, as well as how the object would feel in your hands or what you would do if you had to interact with it.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Really think about this object and place it at the centre of your conscious attention.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>Now, with your attention remained on this object, I want you to close your eyes.</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>Continuing to pay attention to this object, can you still feel it&rsquo;s presence in spite of the fact that you cannot see it?</Text>

<Text style={p}>Afterall the object is still there in your mind, and your attention is still on that object as if it were there, visually in front of you.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Now, with your eyes still closed, I now want you to imagine as if you&rsquo;re moving that object around with your mind.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Perhaps you might want to lift it up and move it to around to your left. Perhaps you might even want to spin it around 180 degrees, and then throw it behind your back.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>Use your imagination and see what you can do with this object.</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>Next, with your eyes still closed, I want you to place your attention on a different object you noticed earlier.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Do the same thing with this object as you did with the previous object.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Rinse and repeat.</Text>

<Text style={p}>While a lot of this may seem silly, the idea behind this exercise is to help you understand that there is nothing concrete, nor necessarily &lsquo;real&rsquo; about our ability to focus.</Text>

<Text style={p}>At the end of the day, it&rsquo;s purely a self-created construct that is developed through practice (and largely desire).</Text>

<Text style={p}>And that really is what I&rsquo;m trying to get at here: Focus is nothing more than a skill that&rsquo;s developed through practice, exactly as you have been doing over the past 5 minutes or so.</Text>

<Text style={p}>There&rsquo;s nothing scary, nor mystic about it.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>It really is as simple as practicing these exercises on a consistent basis, in order to develop the skill of focus.</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>Once you understand this, then it helps you realise not only that we have full-control over our attention.</Text>

<Text style={p}>However that we can develop these simple understandings by changing the way we think about reality.</Text>

<Text style={p}>It really is that simple.</Text>

<Text style={p}>The same goes for all your urges and negative feelings surrounding your addiction. Much like your focus and attention, these things are entirely malleable and are in no way bound by anything in particular.</Text>

<Text style={p}>The sooner you realise this, the sooner you&rsquo;ll be able to overcome your addiction without the constant struggle that often comes with fighting our feelings and emotions.</Text>

<Text style={p}>All you have to do is change the way you interpret reality.</Text>

<Text style={p}>By practicing these exercises everyday.</Text>

<Text style={p}>The idea behind this exercise is to teach you to think of your senses differently.</Text>

<Text style={p}>As humans we&rsquo;re essentially limited by our senses. Which is to say that we can only see, feel and hear as far as our body will allow.</Text>

<Text style={p}>What this exercise is designed to do is help us imagine what it would be like if our senses were extended.</Text>

<Text style={p}>A large part of the exercises here on NeverFap Deluxe revolve around training ourselves to perceive and understand our senses, and so learning to imagine them is an important part of enhancing that process.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Because when you think about it, our senses really are the rawest indications of not only who we are, but what we know of reality.</Text>

<Text style={p}>So once you understand your senses and truly become comfortable with them, you can learn to develop great control over your mind, as well as cement your ability to remain centred.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Not only will this exercise help you better understand your existing senses and your perceived limitations of them, however it will help you better project your understandings of reality overall.</Text>

<View style={hr2}/>

<Text style={h2}>Instructions</Text>

<View style={hr2__bottom}/>







<Text style={p}>For this exercise, what we want to do pretend as if we can see through walls.</Text>

<Text style={p}>So pick a wall, and pretend as if you can see clearly what is on the other side.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Now, this truly is a skill within it&rsquo;s own and I encourage you to really play around with this idea of what it means to be able to &ldquo;see through something&rdquo;.</Text>

<Text style={p}>For example, can you see through multiple walls? If so, can walls ever exist out of principle, if no one can see them?</Text>

<Text style={p}>What does it look like on the other side? Is it clear? Does the fact that because you&rsquo;re looking through something, change the nature of that object?</Text>

<Text style={p}>Is your ability to see through walls a reflection of your eyes, or your mind? Perhaps, is it a reflection of the wall itself? Is it only walls you can see through?</Text>

<Text style={p}>In addition, see if you can imagine different things through that same wall. Perhaps you see a great big ocean, or a vast wide desert. Perhaps it&rsquo;s nothing more than just a single colour.</Text>

<Text style={p}>By playing around with this idea, you can truly explore your senses in a magical way, that will help you not only realise how fantastically fluid they really are.</Text>

<Text style={p}>But also dissolve the self-limiting beliefs you may have about them.</Text>

        <Text style={content__date}>2019-04-20</Text>
        <Text style={p}>The idea behind this exercise is to help you develop awareness throughout your day on an interval basis.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Essentially, the intention behind <Text style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>Every 30 Minutes</Text> is to help keep a constant gauge of what you&rsquo;re doing.</Text>

<Text style={p}>And by doing so, gain a deeper understanding of awareness and routine, in particular of your own life and how you play it out each day.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Routine is a very important part of the recovery process, and this exercise is a way to streamline that process, or at least get you thinking about it in a meaningful way.</Text>

<Text style={p}>In addition, it&rsquo;s a wonderful way to engage your brain, which is really half the battle when it comes to addressing porn addiction.</Text>

<View style={hr2}/>

<Text style={h2}>Instructions</Text>

<View style={hr2__bottom}/>







<Text style={p}>Essentially, your aim with this exercise is to keep a mental timer every 30 minutes, and to record or even just acknowledge what you&rsquo;re doing within in that moment.</Text>

<Text style={p}>In order for this to be effective, you will not be using an alarm to do this.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Instead, you will be using your own intuition, and then checking the clock to see what time it is, and whether you should record what you&rsquo;re doing yet.</Text>

<Text style={p}>The whole idea is that we want to develop this mental timeline ourselves, and the only way we can do this is through practice.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Put simply, an alarm is not a substitute for your own conscious awareness, which is what we are attempting to develop.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Personally I find it helps to do this exercise starting at a time like 8:00am in order to make it easier to track those 30 minute segment.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Although, you&rsquo;re free to do whatever interval works best for you. For example, you might want to experiment with hourly intervals instead.</Text>

<Text style={p}>(although I tend to find the longer the duration, the harder it is for people starting out)</Text>

<Text style={p}>In addition, I want to add that this is can be a real tough one!</Text>

<Text style={p}>Although it sounds easy in practice, humans tend to forget. It&rsquo;s a bit like when we feel distracted during meditation, and we find ourselves thinking about something irrelevant.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Sometimes we can have a hard time maintaining our conscious awareness, however this is precisely why we&rsquo;re practicing this exercise.</Text>

<Text style={p}>So we can focus on what&rsquo;s important.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Our mental health.</Text>

        <Text style={content__date}>2019-04-28</Text>
        <Text style={p}>This is another classic awareness exercise which is short and straight-to-the-point.</Text>

<Text style={p}>It&rsquo;s designed to help you think about something which you ordinarily wouldn&rsquo;t think about, which can help you expand your conscious awareness.</Text>

<Text style={p}>I suppose what I like about this particular variation of awareness exercise, is that it really points out how subtle our focus and attention can be.</Text>

<Text style={p}>While there are much more demanding awareness exercises such as Observe Your Senses this exercise highlights that focus and attention can still be achieved in the day-to-day of our busy lives.</Text>

<Text style={p}>And that&rsquo;s really the beauty of focus and attention.</Text>

<Text style={p}>As outlined in Blind Attention it can be absolutely anything you want it to be, it simply comes down to your ability to conceptually think about it in everyday situations, and this exercise is designed to help you do that.</Text>

<Text style={p}>So without further ado, let&rsquo;s get to the meat of it.</Text>

<View style={hr2}/>

<Text style={h2}>Instructions</Text>

<View style={hr2__bottom}/>







<Text style={p}>For this exercise what you want to do is focus your attention on the right side of your vision.</Text>

<Text style={p}>I find this exercise works most effectively while you&rsquo;re in the middle of doing something, because it&rsquo;s not designed to be particularly taxing.</Text>

<Text style={p}>In fact, it&rsquo;s designed to exist as a subtle overlay over your current thinking and daily functioning, as opposed to a dedicated practice you do when you have 10 minutes to yourself.</Text>

<Text style={p}>I tend to find the real benefit of this exercise comes from how we decide to focus on the right side of our vision.</Text>

<Text style={p}>For example, you may want to physically look at something in the right side of your vision. Alternatively, you may decide to simply imagine something appearing in the right side of your vision.</Text>

<Text style={p}>In a lot of cases, it can be as simple as acknowledging that you have a right arm. There&rsquo;s an infinite number of ways you can practice this exercise throughout the day.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Furthermore, another important aspect of this exercise is consistency. Try to see how often and how long you can maintain your attention on the right side of your vision for.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Not to mention, question why you think you&rsquo;ve been successful/unsuccessful in doing so.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Do you get distracted when you attempt to focus your attention on the right side of your vision? Do you find it hard placing your focus on anything at all?</Text>

<Text style={p}>Certainly, as with all awareness exercises, the more you practice them the better you&rsquo;ll become at training your mind to think in those terms.</Text>

        <Text style={content__date}>2019-05-01</Text>
        

<Text style={p}>This exercise is designed to help you think outside of the box.</Text>

<Text style={p}>It&rsquo;s not a particularly difficult exercise in the sense that it allows for unlimited creativity.</Text>

<Text style={p}>However, it&rsquo;s an exercise that&rsquo;s very difficult to master in the traditional sense of being able to consistently replicate the same thing each time.</Text>

<Text style={p}>I find I learn new things each time I try this exercise, and you&rsquo;ll be surprised at the extent to which you&rsquo;ll also discover new things each time you try it too.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>In this exercise what we'll be doing is coming up with a variety of different ways we can use our hands.</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>How we can move them. Arrange them. Touch them.</Text>

<Text style={p}>And in doing so, realise the extent to which we haven&rsquo;t been thinking before, or at least allowed ourselves the opportunity to think previously.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Because although we use our hands everyday, it&rsquo;s not as if we think about them in certain odd ways, such as how we can arrange them into different shapes and patterns.</Text>

<Text style={p}>I suppose it&rsquo;s a lot like when you&rsquo;re walking down a street you&rsquo;re familiar with, and you happen to notice something completely new that&rsquo;s always been there, yet you hadn&rsquo;t noticed up until that very moment.</Text>

<Text style={p}>By practicing this exercise we can learn to not only think creatively, but also understand that no matter how much we think we know, we don&rsquo;t truly know it all.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Something which often has to be experienced to be believed, hence this exercise.</Text>

<View style={hr2}/>

<Text style={h2}>Instructions</Text>

<View style={hr2__bottom}/>







<Text style={p}>To begin this exercise I want you to first look at your hand.</Text>

<Text style={p}>What do you see? Take notice of the wrinkles on your knuckles. The hair on your fingers. The tone of your skin.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Already, you&rsquo;re probably doing something unique. Chances are you&rsquo;ve never considered staring at your hand for an extended period of time, ever.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Next try and move your fingers around. See if you can make your hand into weird shapes by moving your fingers into odd positions.</Text>

<Text style={p}>What happens once you move your wrist as well? Does it feel natural? What is natural?</Text>

<Text style={p}>Once you&rsquo;ve played around with that idea, get your other hand involved as well.</Text>

<Text style={p}>What arrangements/combinations can you create with two hands? What if you interlace all your fingers together? What if you put both the backs of your hands together?</Text>

<Text style={p}>Remember, this truly is an exercise of creativity, so the aim is to play around and see what you can come up with.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Not only will it help open up your mind, but it will get you thinking about something which you ordinarily wouldn&rsquo;t be thinking about.</Text>

<Text style={p}>No different to your recovery if you&rsquo;re just starting out.</Text>

  return (

        <Text style={content__title}>Focus On Your Finger And Your Background</Text>
        <Text style={content__date}>2019-05-07</Text>
        <Text style={p}>This is a simple exercise most people can benefit from straight-away without too much effort.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Certainly, it was one of the first awareness exercises I learnt when I was starting out with my own mental health journey, and it&rsquo;s one that has stuck with me since.</Text>

<Text style={p}>This exercise involves manipulating your visual field in order to change the depth perception of the objects in front of you, notably your finger and the foreground.</Text>

<Text style={p}>It&rsquo;s a powerful exercise because humans are largely visual creatures, and so to rapidly change our focus so vividly can help us better understand the power which we have over ourselves and our perception of reality.</Text>

<Text style={p}>At a conscious level, we may not realise the extent to which we have control over ourselves and in particular our thoughts, feelings and even senses.</Text>

<Text style={p}>On the other hand, demonstrating first-hand that we do have control over these things aspects of our consciousness is a great way to open our minds and dissolve some of the self-limiting beliefs we may have about what we&rsquo;re capable of as people.</Text>

<Text style={p}>In other words, help us detach from the misconceptions within our own minds, including our ego and all things conceptual.</Text>

<Text style={p}>And the fact that what we&rsquo;re doing here is conscious is really key here, as we&rsquo;re trying to demonstrate power over our mind through our actions.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Because that&rsquo;s ultimately what awareness is all about - learning to use our minds effectively so we no longer allow our subconscious fears and behaviours to control who we are.</Text>

<View style={hr2}/>

<Text style={h2}>Instructions</Text>

<View style={hr2__bottom}/>







<Text style={p}>While the instructions for this exercise are simple, the real benefit comes from the introspection that comes from practicing this exercise.</Text>

<Text style={p}>No different to any other awareness exercises.</Text>

<Text style={p}>In order to practice this exercise, what you&rsquo;ll want to do is place your hand in front of your face with one finger pointing up.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Essentially, have it far away enough so you can see your finger clearly, but not so close that&hellip; I&rsquo;m sure you get the drift.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Now, what you&rsquo;ll want to do is focus on that finger. Simply focus your vision on that finger, and notice what you see.</Text>

<Text style={p}>If practiced successfully, you should be able to see your finger very clearly. I mean, it is right in front of your face, afterall.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Now, ask yourself a few questions. Are you able to focus on anything else while focusing on your finger? What about the background, are you able to focus on that as well?</Text>

<Text style={p}>Once you&rsquo;ve done this for about a minute-or-so, I now want you to focus your attention on something in the background.</Text>

<Text style={p}>It could be a tree. It could be something on you wall. Generally, the further away it is the better this works.</Text>

<Text style={p}>And with your focus shifted, I want you to gauge your change of perspective and truly understand the significance of what you&rsquo;ve achieved here.</Text>

<Text style={p}>With your focus on that object in the distance, what do you notice? Are you able to see your finger clearly at all?</Text>

<Text style={p}>Ultimately, this exercise teaches us a few different things.</Text>

<Text style={p}>It teaches us that although we can have two objects in front of us, where we place our attention ultimately dictates what our experience will be.</Text>

<Text style={p}>In addition, it also teaches us the importance that we play as individuals in regards to how we perceive reality.</Text>

<Text style={p}>When we focused on the background, our finger itself didn&rsquo;t change. What changed was our perception of that finger, due to where we placed our attention.</Text>

<Text style={p}>There are also a number of additional lessons we can learn from this exercise, however I&rsquo;ll leave that up to you to explore!</Text>

export const CatchOutYourJudgements = ({ componentId }: any) => {

        <Text style={content__title}>Catch Out Your Judgements</Text>
        <Text style={content__date}>2019-05-12</Text>
        

<Text style={p}>This exercise is a great way to help you understand when and why you make judgements throughout the day.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Furthermore, it&rsquo;s a relatively straight-forward exercise, so let&rsquo;s get started!</Text>

<Text style={p}>First of all, I want to start off by saying that there&rsquo;s nothing necessarily wrong with making judgements.</Text>

<Text style={p}>What often happens when people do this exercise, is that they freak out at the true extent of which they&rsquo;re being judgemental.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Which ironically enough, causes people to react with even more judgement and that&rsquo;s exactly what we&rsquo;re trying to avoid.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Sure, being excessively judgemental isn&rsquo;t the best thing for your mental health, however negatively reacting to it is equally as counter-productive.</Text>



<Text style={p}>Much like with the <Text style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>Observe Your Senses</Text> exercise, all we really want to do is acknowledge and observe how our mind works.</Text>

<Text style={p}>We&rsquo;re not trying to change our behaviour, nor condemn it in any way.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>In fact, the entire purpose of this exercise is to practice our ability to observe.</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>And what a lot of people don&rsquo;t know, is that observation itself is what brings about change.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Not focusing on raw change itself, which usually results in some form of emotional manipulation or judgement - which simply doesn&rsquo;t work as an effective, nor long-term strategy.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Only once we&rsquo;ve mastered observation can we then understand the true nature of effective change, which you&rsquo;ll discover the more you practice observation within your own life.</Text>

<Text style={p}>One thing to keep in mind is that if you are the kind of person who generally reacts with judgement, then this will be a tough exercise for you.</Text>

<Text style={p}>In part because it means you&rsquo;re stuck within your own bubble of unconscious judgement, which you may not quite realise.</Text>

<Text style={p}>But that&rsquo;s okay too.</Text>

<Text style={p}>We all have to start somewhere with addressing certain aspects of our mental health, and this is a great exercise for doing just that.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Furthermore, your struggle merely becomes another reference point for you to observe. Where you can mentally say to yourself:</Text>

<Text style={p}><Text style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>&ldquo;Ah, so that&rsquo;s what my mind does when I react to a judgement. Duely noted.&rdquo;</Text></Text>

<View style={hr2}/>

<Text style={h2}>Instructions</Text>

<View style={hr2__bottom}/>







<Text style={p}>All we want to do with this exercise is catch ourselves and acknowledge when we&rsquo;ve made a judgement.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Now, there&rsquo;s really only one recommended way that you approach this, which is to acknowledge the judgement as I briefly demonstrated above.</Text>

<Text style={p}><Text style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>&ldquo;Ah, so that&rsquo;s what my mind does. Duely noted.&rdquo;</Text></Text>

<Text style={p}>The idea behind acknowledgement is that we merely want to take note of it, without creating any further judgements.</Text>

<Text style={p}>In essence we want to remain neutral, if not because you should be neutral in all your thoughts anyway.</Text>

<Text style={p}>It&rsquo;s part of what being calm and collected is all about.</Text>

<Text style={p}>In addition, take note of your feelings at the point of judgement. Did you make the judgement because you were feeling angry? Was it because you were feeling depressed?</Text>

<Text style={p}>The reason why this is important is because becoming aware of our feelings is often the easiest way to catch a judgement before it happens.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Essentially, because most judgements produce some sort of feeling in some way, so there&rsquo;s usually a direct correlation between the two.</Text>

<View style={hr4}/>

<Text style={h4}>Ultimately, this is an exercise of observation, and observation is the skill we're trying to develop.</Text>

<View style={hr4__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>We&rsquo;re not doing this to feel justified that we caught a judgement. (which funnily enough is a judgement within itself)</Text>

<Text style={p}>We&rsquo;re doing this so we can learn to become more aware of ourselves through observation, and really develop this skill so we can continue to remain aware into the future.</Text>

<Text style={p}>And the sooner we can do this, the sooner we can gain control over our porn addiction.</Text>

        <Text style={p}>This is arguably one of the hardest exercises you can practice.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Certainly, it&rsquo;s an exercise that I continue to struggle with and perhaps will never truly understand.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Of course, this isn&rsquo;t to say that it isn&rsquo;t useful as a thought exercise. More that it&rsquo;s an exercise that can tend to produce more anger and frustration, than enlightenment.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Although, that&rsquo;s also part of the challenge.</Text>

<Text style={p}>This exercise is a bit like asking you to imagine what a cube would look like in 4D. It&rsquo;s not something we can inherently do provided our limited ability to perceive only in 3D.</Text>

<Text style={p}>No matter how we try to think about it, we can provide no meaningful answer that will intuitively make sense based on our 3D understanding of the world.</Text>

<Text style={p}>And part of the magic of this exercise is learning to come to terms with the fact that there is no perfect answer, let alone any coherent answer at all.</Text>

<Text style={p}>This is where you&rsquo;ll discover the most benefit from practicing this exercise.</Text>

<View style={hr2}/>

<Text style={h2}>Instructions</Text>

<View style={hr2__bottom}/>







<Text style={p}>I want you to think about your mind.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Your mind is what allows you to think, feel and perceive reality.</Text>

<Text style={p}>When we bunch all these things together what we effectively create is our conscious experience.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Now, I want you to ask yourself.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>Where does your consciousness come from?</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>Does your consciousness come from your mind? Does it come from your eyes? Is there any single point of consciousness you can pin point, in the cloud of sensation that you&rsquo;re currently experiencing?</Text>

<Text style={p}>Furthermore, I want you to attempt to do something profound. I want you to attempt to look at that which is perceiving.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Which is to say, I want you to try and locate the centre of your consciousness.</Text>

<Text style={p}>What does it look like? Is there even a centre? Is the centre merely temporary? Is there even a consciousness to locate at all?</Text>

<Text style={p}>The difficulty of this exercise derives from the fact that it&rsquo;s incredibly difficult to interpret something you are.</Text>

<Text style={p}>It&rsquo;s a bit like asking someone to describe what they look like, when they&rsquo;ve never seen a reflection of themselves in the mirror.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Now to add to the perplexity of the situation, imagine how frustrating it would be trying to describe what you look like, when you&rsquo;ve never even seen another human being before?</Text>

<Text style={p}>That&rsquo;s a bit what this exercise is like, because we only have our own consciousness to relate to, and even then no one quite knows what it is.</Text>

<Text style={p}>So not only does this exercise require an incredible amount of thinking outside of the box, however it&rsquo;s a thought exercise which may not even be possible at all.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Regardless, like all awareness exercises the benefit comes from the process, so play around with the idea and see where it takes you.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Certainly, none of it may make any sense at all, let alone ever.</Text>

<Text style={p}>However the more you think about the idea, the easier it will become to remove those conceptual barriers and even come to a point of acceptance where this may make sense to you in some form, even if it doesn&rsquo;t directly address all your concerns.</Text>

<Text style={p}>I highly encourage you stick with it for a few days at least.</Text>

<Text style={p}>And see where it takes you.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Essentially, I want you to make a mental note any time you see the colour yellow.</Text>

<Text style={p}>It could be as simple as a mere thought. You may even want to stare at it and really gauge it&rsquo;s presence.</Text>

<Text style={p}>For this particular exercise what we really want to do is gain inspiration from our surroundings and really focus our attention on what is currently taking place within our vision.</Text>

<Text style={p}>It&rsquo;s a relatively simple exercise, yet a highly effective one at engaging with your conscious mind.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Which is a key point to make with all these exercises.</Text>

<Text style={p}>They are designed to teach you to consciously engage with your mind, so that when you&rsquo;re having an urge for example, you can engage with it in a meaningful way.</Text>
