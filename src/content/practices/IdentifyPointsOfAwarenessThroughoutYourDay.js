<Text style={p}>This exercise is designed to help you keep on top of your awareness throughout the day.</Text>

<Text style={p}>By becoming more conscious of the events throughout our day, we can become more conscious of the things we do within it.</Text>

<Text style={p}>With this exercise, what we&rsquo;re attempting to do is become conscious of key moments throughout our day.</Text>

<View style={ul}>
<Text style={li}><Text style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>When we wake up.</Text></Text>
<Text style={li}><Text style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>When we shower.</Text></Text>
<Text style={li}><Text style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>When we travel to work.</Text></Text>
<Text style={li}><Text style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>During our lunch break.</Text></Text>
<Text style={li}><Text style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>At dinner.</Text></Text>

<Text style={p}>The key thing to understand about awareness is that we&rsquo;re not actually aware unless if we exercise it.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Largely, most of us do all of the things mentioned above, without truly being aware that they&rsquo;re actually happening.</Text>

<Text style={p}>I mean, how many times have you consciously thought about something from the very moment you&rsquo;ve woken up?</Text>

<Text style={p}>You know, about a giraffe or that you&rsquo;re well and alive with two wonderful eyes?</Text>

<Text style={p}>Chances are those thoughts have simply never occurred to you, because instead, you go into autopilot mode where you just follow the motions.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>For this exercise, we want to do is start engaging our brain so that we can have those thoughts at these key moments throughout the day.</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>The idea is that once we become more conscious of what&rsquo;s happening throughout our day, it can become a lot easier to detect and stop negative habits from reoccurring.</Text>

<Text style={p}>In particular, to better address our cravings, as well as those moments associated to our addiction where we feel as if we are not in control.</Text>

<Text style={p}>And despite this exercise being relatively straight forward, it&rsquo;s an exercise that a lot of people struggle with, because it&rsquo;s a completely different way of engaging with the world.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Becoming aware is not easy when you haven&rsquo;t consciously made an effort in the past to be aware before.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Of course, practice makes perfect.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Essentially this is an exercise of acknowledgement.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Throughout your day, simply acknowledge what&rsquo;s taking place at that time.</Text>

<Text style={p}>For more specificity, you can identify the location, time and what exactly you&rsquo;re doing.</Text>

<Text style={p}>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s 7am and I&rsquo;m currently brushing my teeth in the bathroom.&rdquo;</Text>

<Text style={p}>At this point, I want you to focus on how you feel.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Are you feeling tired? Are you feeling neutral? Are you feeling angry?</Text>

<Text style={p}>Regardless of how you feel, the idea is to get you to think about these events and how they relate to your emotions.</Text>

<Text style={p}>The other reason behind doing this, is that by identifying how you feel, it actually allows you to dissociate from your emotions and not take them personally.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Of course, you don&rsquo;t need to think about. It simply comes naturally.</Text>

<Text style={p}>The end goal here, aside from engaging your awareness, is to acknowledge and not react emotionally.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Because the more you do this, the more you know ahead of time how you will feel, and progressively overtime you will simply feel neutral at these particular time triggers throughout your day.</Text>

<Text style={p}>This is a truly fantastic exercise that I do everyday and it serves as an amazing anchor for my emotions.</Text>

<Text style={p}>You engage your awareness from the very moment you wake up, and it just gives you such a strong foothold over how you feel throughout the day.</Text>
