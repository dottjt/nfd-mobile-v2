        <Text style={p}>This is another one of those classic awareness exercises where we pay attention to some aspect of our reality.</Text>

<Text style={p}>In this exercise we&rsquo;re going to be paying attention to the colour yellow.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Essentially, I want you to make a mental note any time you see the colour yellow.</Text>

<Text style={p}>It could be as simple as a mere thought. You may even want to stare at it and really gauge it&rsquo;s presence.</Text>

<Text style={p}>For this particular exercise what we really want to do is gain inspiration from our surroundings and really focus our attention on what is currently taking place within our vision.</Text>

<Text style={p}>It&rsquo;s a relatively simple exercise, yet a highly effective one at engaging with your conscious mind.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Which is a key point to make with all these exercises.</Text>

<Text style={p}>They are designed to teach you to consciously engage with your mind, so that when you&rsquo;re having an urge for example, you can engage with it in a meaningful way.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Rather than flail around as if you have no control over yourself, which simply isn&rsquo;t true.</Text>

<Text style={p}>That&rsquo;s right kids!</Text>

<Text style={p}>For this exercise what we&rsquo;re going to do is notice the colour yellow.</Text>

<Text style={p}>How you decide to do this is up to you. You can write it down. You can simply acknowledge it in your head.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Furthermore, how do you react when you see the colour yellow? Do you react at all? Is there a particular feeling that this exercise evokes?</Text>

<Text style={p}>Fun Fact: Yellow is apparently the most appealing and memorable colour.</Text>
