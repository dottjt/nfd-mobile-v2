<Text style={p}>This exercise is one of the easiest ways to start building your awareness.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>Essentially, it involves slowing down your mind so that you can open yourself to the opportunity of being aware.</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>One of the most common ways we weaken our ability to be aware is by losing control over our thoughts.</Text>

<Text style={p}>And the reason why we lose control over our thoughts is because they can be almost impossible to track when they&rsquo;re zooming around in our head at a million miles per hour.</Text>

<Text style={p}>In other words, because we&rsquo;re overthinking.</Text>

<Text style={p}>In most cases we don&rsquo;t even realise we&rsquo;re overthinking, because we&rsquo;re so consumed by our thoughts that we don&rsquo;t even allow ourselves the opportunity to realise what&rsquo;s going on.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Which over time can form into an instinctual reaction towards dealing with our negative feelings and emotions.</Text>

<View style={hr2}/>

<Text style={h2}>Certainly, for most people, porn addiction is merely a subconscious response.</Text>

<View style={hr2__bottom}/>







<Text style={p}>And this exercise is designed to help break that cycle.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Rather than attempt to identify and qualify these thoughts, what we&rsquo;re going to do is simply going to focus on the raw process and sensation of thinking.</Text>

<Text style={p}>And in doing so, embrace the physical sensation of what it actually feels like to be in control of our minds, in order to create a strong foundation for being able to control what we think and feel.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>Because when we're in control of our mind, it's almost as if everything is moving in slow motion.</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>The key thing to understand about maintaining control over our minds is that isn&rsquo;t necessarily about being able to react to what&rsquo;s in front of us.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Instead, a large part of maintaining control is about being able to prepare ourselves mentally for the events that will take place in the future.</Text>

<Text style={p}>The idea being that we can then catch ourselves before we begin overthinking, and identify these patterns before they become unmanagable.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Because when our mind is racing at a million miles per hour, it can become incredibly difficult, if not impossible to slow it down.</Text>

<View style={hr4}/>

<Text style={h4}>Which is why people inevitably relapse.</Text>

<View style={hr4__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>Because at that point, you&rsquo;ve already lost control.</Text>

<Text style={p}>By practicing <Text style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>Slow it down</Text> you will learn how to slow down your mind on a regular basis.</Text>

<Text style={p}>In order to demonstrate control, and create those neural connections in your brain.</Text>

<Text style={p}>In addition, it will help you understand how to become a more calm and collected person, exposing in the process the futility and self-destructiveness of letting our thoughts control us.</Text>

<Text style={h2}>Instructions</Text>

<View style={hr2__bottom}/>







<Text style={p}>When you have a moment, just slow down your mind.</Text>

<Text style={p}>This tends to work best when you&rsquo;re in the middle of doing something, because that&rsquo;s usually when your mind is engaged and requires relaxation.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Keep in mind that there are two different aspects to this exercise:
Mental and physical.</Text>

<Text style={p}>For example, when I&rsquo;m walking down the street, aside from slowing down my thoughts, I will also sometimes physically slow down, even stopping where I stand.</Text>

<Text style={p}>The idea is to prove control over yourself, even when you have other intentions, such as getting to a destination on time.</Text>

<Text style={p}>An idea that will prove very important in following exercises.</Text>
