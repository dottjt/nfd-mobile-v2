        <Text style={p}>This is arguably one of the hardest exercises you can practice.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Certainly, it&rsquo;s an exercise that I continue to struggle with and perhaps will never truly understand.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Of course, this isn&rsquo;t to say that it isn&rsquo;t useful as a thought exercise. More that it&rsquo;s an exercise that can tend to produce more anger and frustration, than enlightenment.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Although, that&rsquo;s also part of the challenge.</Text>

<Text style={p}>This exercise is a bit like asking you to imagine what a cube would look like in 4D. It&rsquo;s not something we can inherently do provided our limited ability to perceive only in 3D.</Text>

<Text style={p}>No matter how we try to think about it, we can provide no meaningful answer that will intuitively make sense based on our 3D understanding of the world.</Text>

<Text style={p}>And part of the magic of this exercise is learning to come to terms with the fact that there is no perfect answer, let alone any coherent answer at all.</Text>

<Text style={p}>This is where you&rsquo;ll discover the most benefit from practicing this exercise.</Text>

<View style={hr2}/>

<Text style={h2}>Instructions</Text>

<View style={hr2__bottom}/>







<Text style={p}>I want you to think about your mind.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Your mind is what allows you to think, feel and perceive reality.</Text>

<Text style={p}>When we bunch all these things together what we effectively create is our conscious experience.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Now, I want you to ask yourself.</Text>

<View style={hr3}/>

<Text style={h3}>Where does your consciousness come from?</Text>

<View style={hr3__bottom}/>


<Text style={p}>Does your consciousness come from your mind? Does it come from your eyes? Is there any single point of consciousness you can pin point, in the cloud of sensation that you&rsquo;re currently experiencing?</Text>

<Text style={p}>Furthermore, I want you to attempt to do something profound. I want you to attempt to look at that which is perceiving.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Which is to say, I want you to try and locate the centre of your consciousness.</Text>

<Text style={p}>What does it look like? Is there even a centre? Is the centre merely temporary? Is there even a consciousness to locate at all?</Text>

<Text style={p}>The difficulty of this exercise derives from the fact that it&rsquo;s incredibly difficult to interpret something you are.</Text>

<Text style={p}>It&rsquo;s a bit like asking someone to describe what they look like, when they&rsquo;ve never seen a reflection of themselves in the mirror.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Now to add to the perplexity of the situation, imagine how frustrating it would be trying to describe what you look like, when you&rsquo;ve never even seen another human being before?</Text>

<Text style={p}>That&rsquo;s a bit what this exercise is like, because we only have our own consciousness to relate to, and even then no one quite knows what it is.</Text>

<Text style={p}>So not only does this exercise require an incredible amount of thinking outside of the box, however it&rsquo;s a thought exercise which may not even be possible at all.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Regardless, like all awareness exercises the benefit comes from the process, so play around with the idea and see where it takes you.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Certainly, none of it may make any sense at all, let alone ever.</Text>

<Text style={p}>However the more you think about the idea, the easier it will become to remove those conceptual barriers and even come to a point of acceptance where this may make sense to you in some form, even if it doesn&rsquo;t directly address all your concerns.</Text>

<Text style={p}>I highly encourage you stick with it for a few days at least.</Text>

<Text style={p}>And see where it takes you.</Text>
