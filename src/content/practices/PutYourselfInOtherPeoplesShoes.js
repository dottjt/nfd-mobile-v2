          <Text style={h1}>Put Yourself In Other People's Shoes</Text>
          <Text style={p}>This exercise can be inherently difficult.</Text>

<Text style={p}>In large part because it demands you to think consciously beyond which you may feel comfortable.</Text>

<Text style={p}>In fact, half the reason why you&rsquo;re addicted to porn is because of all the subconscious behaviours you&rsquo;ve been constructing over the years, in order to deal with your own feelings of inadequacy etc.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Which meant putting your conscious awareness aside, which has now grown weak and must be retrained again from scratch.</Text>

<Text style={p}>With this exercise what we&rsquo;re going to attempt to do is to try and understand what it&rsquo;s like to be in the shoes of others.</Text>

<Text style={p}>And this kind of empathy is most prominent when we&rsquo;re watching documentaries based on humanitarian crisis or exploitation, where we get to see people struggle first-hand.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Certainly part of the reason why this is easy, as opposed to what you&rsquo;ll be attempting to do, is because you get to hear the stories of those people first-hand.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Instead of these people however, I want you to try and understand the people around you, whether that be your own friends and family, or even random strangers in public.</Text>

<Text style={p}>At the very least, to observe your own feelings of how you perceive others.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Now, although this may seem like an opportunity to judge, mock and possibly even condemn others, this truly isn&rsquo;t the purpose of the exercise.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Essentially, it comes down to two different thing:</Text>

<Text style={p}><Text style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>How you genuinely feel about others from their own individual point of view.</Text></Text>

<Text style={p}><Text style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>Observing and questioning the validity of those feelings.</Text></Text>

<Text style={p}>And the benefits of this exercise are numerous.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Most prominently, attempting to try and understand others is an excellent way to uncover the extent to which we misunderstand ourselves.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Because if you&rsquo;re feeling particularly negative about someone (or possibly positive) then that usually reflects in how we see ourselves.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Which is to say that our empathy is often a reflection of our ability to judge and self-criticise.</Text>

<Text style={p}>For this exercise what we want to do is try and imagine what it&rsquo;s like to be others from their point of view.</Text>

<Text style={p}>This exercise works best when you&rsquo;re in public, usually sitting on public transport where you and the other person are both present.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Obviously, don&rsquo;t go crazy and stare at the other person, but I&rsquo;m sure you get the idea.</Text>

<Text style={p}>What can really help with this exercise is to first put all of your feelings and emotions aside, and just imagine a neutral version of yourself.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Then with this neutral version, imagine the other person being the same as well.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Starting with this blank slate can help immensely, because there&rsquo;s no point jumping to conclusions straight away.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Then once you&rsquo;re in that neutral mindset, you can begin to observe.</Text>

<Text style={p}>Does the other person look tense, or perhaps is it you who&rsquo;s actually tense?</Text>

<Text style={p}>Are they happy, sad or entirely neutral? Does it look like their mind is pre-occupied? How can you possibly know?</Text>

<Text style={p}>How do you personally feel doing this exercise? Do you find it difficult or easy?</Text>

<Text style={p}>In addition, also realise the extent to which you simply cannot be empathetic.</Text>

<Text style={p}>What aspects of a person can you not feel? Is it because they&rsquo;re aspects which you struggle to feel yourself?</Text>

<Text style={p}>Certainly, you may be surprised with what you discover.</Text>
